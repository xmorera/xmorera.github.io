  <div><p>Here’s a hard truth I see in many companies: They <em>can </em>produce "learning activity". But they are terrible at producing learning.</p><p>The reason is that most organizations still treat “learning” as a content problem.</p><p>They ask:</p><ul><li><p>How many courses do we have?</p></li><li><p>How many hours of training did people complete?</p></li><li><p>How many modules did we ship this quarter?</p></li></ul><p>Those are activity metrics, not learning metrics.</p><p>Real learning shows up as change:</p><ul><li><p>Fewer escalations.</p></li><li><p>Faster onboarding.</p></li><li><p>More consistent customer conversations.</p></li><li><p>Fewer deployment mistakes.</p></li><li><p>Better decisions, made independently.</p></li><li><p>And being able to track this as a whole, which is why <a href="http://Lupo.ai" target="_blank">Lupo.ai</a> is evolving from a educational content production system to a platform devoted to delivering and measuring learning in organizations like yours.</p></li></ul><p>Let's start with what's wrong. The first question in any learning strategy is not “What content do we need?” It is:</p><p>What change do we want to see in the next 30–90 days?  </p><p>If that is not clear, everything else – formats, tools, platforms, budgets – becomes guesswork.</p><p>Once you define the change you want, the rest of the strategy becomes a design problem: who needs to change, in what way, and what is the best route to get them there?</p><hr><h3>The core elements of effective learning</h3><p>When I design or review a learning strategy, I look for a few core elements. If these are missing, no amount of technology will save it.</p><h3>1. A precise outcome</h3><p>“Improve product knowledge” is not a learning goal. It is a wish.</p><p>“Within 60 days, new support engineers can resolve 80% of tickets in category X without escalation” is a learning goal.</p><p>Precise outcomes:</p><ul><li><p>Anchor the content.</p></li><li><p>Clarify what “good” looks like.</p></li><li><p>Make it possible to measure progress.</p></li><li><p>Help you say “no” to nice-but-irrelevant topics.</p></li></ul><p>Video helps here because you can illustrate what “good” looks like directly: a real call, a real troubleshooting process, a real delivery of a pitch – not just a description.</p><h3>2. A clear understanding of the audience</h3><p>The same topic can require very different learning experiences:</p><ul><li><p>A new engineer vs. a senior architect.</p></li><li><p>A frontline support agent vs. a customer success manager.</p></li><li><p>A first-time manager vs. a seasoned leader.</p></li></ul><p>If you design a “one size fits all” course, you usually end up with “one size fits nobody.”</p><p>With video, you can:</p><ul><li><p>Create targeted tracks for different roles while reusing core explanations.</p></li><li><p>Record separate intros that frame why this matters for each audience.</p></li><li><p>Layer context: a foundational video for everyone, followed by role-specific follow-ups.</p></li></ul><p>When you truly understand who you are teaching, you stop designing “courses” and start designing journeys.</p><h3>3. A video-first medium strategy</h3><p>Here is where I am opinionated: for most organizations, video should be the primary medium for explaining concepts, demonstrating workflows, and capturing expertise.</p><p>Not the only medium. But the backbone.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because video lets you:</p><ul><li><p>Show, not only tell. You can demonstrate tools, flows, and behaviors.</p></li><li><p>Capture tacit knowledge. People can explain how they think, not just what they do.</p></li><li><p>Keep a consistent message. Every new hire hears the same explanation.</p></li><li><p>Scale your best people. Your best engineer or sales rep can “teach” thousands of times without being in the room.</p></li><li><p>Combine modes. Visuals, audio, stories, demos – all in one place.</p></li></ul><p>Text and slides are great for reference, checklists, and summaries. But for the initial transfer of understanding, video is hard to beat.</p><p>The mistake many companies make is treating video as an afterthought: “Let’s record the webinar and upload it somewhere.” That is not a strategy. That is an archive. <em>This one in particular tells me a lot about an organization. I cringe when someone tells me they "record zooms" to train their customers/employees!</em></p><p>A video-first strategy means you intentionally design learning around video as the core explanation layer, and then support it with other formats.</p><hr><h3>From random acts of training to a video-powered system</h3><p>An effective learning function is not a collection of courses. It is a system.</p><p>Here is how a video-centered learning system comes together.</p><h3>1. Map the critical knowledge flows</h3><p>Every organization has a few leverage points where better learning pays off quickly:</p><ul><li><p>Onboarding into complex products.</p></li><li><p>Customer-facing conversations (sales, success, support).</p></li><li><p>Risk-sensitive processes (security, compliance, operations).</p></li><li><p>Internal tools and workflows that are unintuitive but essential.</p></li></ul><p>Start there.</p><p>For each area, ask:</p><ul><li><p>What are the highest-value tasks people need to perform?</p></li><li><p>Where do they commonly get stuck?</p></li><li><p>Where do mistakes cost the most?</p></li></ul><p>Those are your first candidates for structured video training.</p><h3>2. Build a “content factory,” not random recordings</h3><p>High-impact video training does not come from hero efforts. It comes from a repeatable process.</p><p>A simple “content factory” for video might include:</p><ul><li><p>A clear intake process: how requests for training topics come in and get prioritized.</p></li><li><p>Standard formats: short “explainer” videos, deep-dive walkthroughs, scenario-based practice, “day in the life” recordings.</p></li><li><p>Lightweight production standards: decent audio, clean screen capture, simple editing, branded intro/outro.</p></li><li><p>Modular design: breaking topics into focused, 5–15 minute segments that can be reused across pathways.</p></li></ul><p>You do not need a Hollywood studio. You need consistency and a bias for clarity over polish.</p><h3>3. Choose platforms that respect how people learn</h3><p>If your video training lives in a place nobody visits, it does not exist.</p><p>Your learning stack should:</p><ul><li><p>Make it easy to search and discover relevant videos.</p></li><li><p>Integrate with the tools people already use (chat, CRM, code repo, support system).</p></li><li><p>Handle permissions and access cleanly.</p></li><li><p>Track engagement and outcomes at a useful level of detail.</p></li></ul><p>The right stack depends on your context: existing LMS/LXP, internal platforms, security requirements. The important thing is that video is not isolated. It should sit inside the flow of work, not off in a separate silo.</p><h3>4. Layer in practice, feedback, and application</h3><p>Video explains. Practice transforms.</p><p>For each key concept, ask:</p><ul><li><p>How will learners apply this in their real environment?</p></li><li><p>How can we simulate that?</p></li><li><p>How will they get feedback?</p></li></ul><p>This might look like:</p><ul><li><p>After watching a video, reps record their own version of a pitch for review.</p></li><li><p>Engineers watch a debugging walkthrough and then fix a similar issue in a safe environment.</p></li><li><p>Managers watch a coaching conversation and then practice in pairs.</p></li></ul><p>Video is the backbone, but practice and feedback are the muscles that build real capability.</p><hr><h3>How AI makes video training even more powerful</h3><p>Once you have a solid base of video training, AI becomes a force multiplier.</p><p>Here are a few practical ways:</p><ul><li><p>Search: instead of remembering which 40-minute video contains a specific explanation, learners can search across transcripts and jump to the exact moment they need. </p></li><li><p>Summaries and outlines: AI can turn a long training video into a written summary, key points, or step-by-step instructions.</p></li><li><p>Personalization: the same video library can serve different roles by generating tailored “paths” or recommendations.</p></li><li><p>Q&amp;A: learners can ask questions against your video and documentation library and get answers grounded in your own content.</p></li></ul><p>Update: To improve the experience, we have added AI Agents to our <a href="http://lupo.ai" target="_blank">lupo.ai</a> videos, so that learners don't have to watch the entire video. Instead, the learner gets an immedate text explanation and can jump exactly to the part where he or she can learn exactly what they need. </p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4E12AQEl-z3u5ohIhg" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQEl-z3u5ohIhg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/B4EZuOhXknJwAU-/0/1767622671323?e=1769644800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=KHWm9-h3RhSitArt39ZYMwXPLqbBO2cLEw_LXMPSHLE"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The important part: AI works best when you already have high-quality, structured video content. It does not replace the need to think clearly about what you teach and why. It amplifies it.</p><hr><h3>Common pitfalls in learning strategies (and how video helps)</h3><p>I see a few recurring problems in learning initiatives. A video-centered approach, done well, helps address them.</p><h3>1. Technology before purpose</h3><p>Teams often start by choosing tools: “We need a new LXP,” or “Let’s buy this microlearning platform.”</p><p>Without a clear outcome and audience, those tools become expensive storage.</p><p>By starting with the change you want and the people you serve, you design an experience first. Then you choose whatever tools best support that – often with video at the center.</p><h3>2. One-off training events</h3><p>A big workshop, a launch “bootcamp,” a mandatory course – and then nothing.</p><p>Learning decays quickly when it is not reinforced.</p><p>With video:</p><ul><li><p>You can break big topics into a sequence of short hits over time.</p></li><li><p>You can provide on-demand refreshers exactly when people need them.</p></li><li><p>You can keep content aligned with product changes without redesigning from scratch.</p></li></ul><p>Instead of a one-time “event,” you build a continuous learning environment.</p><h3>3. The “video graveyard”</h3><p>This one is ironic: organizations move to video and then bury everything.</p><p>They record meetings, webinars, and talks, upload them somewhere, and never touch them again. No structure, no indexing, no clear purpose.</p><p>Avoiding the graveyard requires:</p><ul><li><p>Intentional design: each video has a clear purpose and target audience.</p></li><li><p>Curation: old or redundant content gets retired or replaced.</p></li><li><p>Navigation: learners understand how videos fit into a broader journey.</p></li><li><p>Analytics: you watch what gets used and what does not, and adjust.</p></li></ul><p>Video is powerful when it is curated. Otherwise it is just storage.</p><hr><h3>A practical roadmap: your next 90 days</h3><p>If you want to move toward a more effective, video-centered learning strategy, you do not need a massive program to start. Here is a simple 90-day roadmap.</p><p><strong>Days 1–15: Define and select</strong></p><ul><li><p>Identify 1–3 high-leverage areas (onboarding, a key product, a high-impact workflow).</p></li><li><p>For each, define a concrete behavior change you want to see.</p></li><li><p>Choose one area as your pilot.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Days 16–45: Design and produce</strong></p><ul><li><p>Break the topic into a short sequence of focused video lessons (5–15 minutes each).</p></li><li><p>Define what practice or application will accompany each lesson.</p></li><li><p>Record video with a small group of subject-matter experts using simple, repeatable templates.</p></li><li><p>Host the videos in a place where your pilot audience can easily access them.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Days 46–75: Launch and learn</strong></p><ul><li><p>Run a small cohort through the pilot learning journey.</p></li><li><p>Measure simple before/after metrics related to your goal (time to proficiency, error rates, confidence).</p></li><li><p>Collect qualitative feedback: what worked, what felt confusing, where they needed more examples.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Days 76–90: Refine and scale</strong></p><ul><li><p>Improve the videos that caused friction: clarify explanations, add short recaps, tighten pacing.</p></li><li><p>Decide how to extend this approach to the next topic or team.</p></li><li><p>Start building the “content factory” habits: intake, standards, and review cycles.</p></li></ul><p>By the end of 90 days, you will not have a complete learning strategy for your entire organization. But you will have something more valuable: a working, video-centered learning system in one critical area, with real results.</p><p>From there, scaling is a matter of repetition and refinement.</p><hr><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>Learning is one of the few advantages that compounds over time.</p><p>If you treat it as a checkbox, you get checkbox results: completed courses, unread PDFs, and frustrated teams.</p><p>If you treat it as a strategic capability built around clear outcomes, a deep understanding of your audience, and a video-first approach supported by good systems, you create something much more powerful: an organization that can upgrade itself continuously.</p><p>That is why, when I think about the key elements of effective learning today, I keep coming back to the same conclusion:</p><p>Define the change you want. Understand who needs to make that change. Then leverage a video-powered learning system that makes it almost inevitable, which is what we do at www.lupo.ai</p></div>
