  <div><p>I am on a personal mission to make an impact in the world through AI-powered learning. Let me tell you my story.</p><p>I've always been passionate about sharing knowledge, one training at a time. But now I am taking it to the next level. I am making an impact by scaling video training creation, with AI. </p><p>Throughout my 20+ years creating and delivering training for industry leaders like Microsoft, Intel, HP, Cloudera, and Pluralsight, I observed firsthand how transformative great education can be.</p><p>But I also saw a critical problem: Creating high-quality, scalable training was slow, costly, and often inaccessible. The expertise was there—but the ability to effectively share that expertise globally was not.</p><p>That's why I created <a href="http://Lupo.ai" target="_blank"><strong>Lupo.ai</strong></a>. Lupo’s mission is simple yet powerful: <strong>to democratize knowledge transfer by removing technical, linguistic, and logistical barriers</strong>. </p><p>I guess that's quite a mouthful. Just think of it this way, we are leveling the playing field by allowing anyone to create professional video training with just access to a computer and internet.</p><p>We are solving the "<strong>talent is distributed equally worldwide, but opportunity is not</strong>" problem. </p><p>Imagine taking your existing text, PowerPoint, or Google Slides and transforming them instantly into professional, engaging training videos—available in over 70 languages, and accessible to anyone, anywhere. You can scale training, reusing your existing assets.</p><p>And Lupo doesn't just only create video. It can help you create content too!</p><p>We're leveraging AI because it's no longer just an optional tech—it’s essential. Companies using AI in their Learning &amp; Development (L&amp;D) initiatives see measurable results:</p><ul><li><p>Faster onboarding and upskilling</p></li><li><p>Dramatic reductions in content creation costs</p></li><li><p>Consistent, engaging learner experiences at scale</p></li></ul><p>One of our customers spent a few thousand dollars creating a customer education program in video and overnight they are saving about 2000 hours in onboarding and ongoing time. <strong>This roughly equates to about $60 thousand dollars saved a year plus the additional revenue from new customers.</strong></p><p>AI is here to stay, particularly in the L&amp;D space. As the global economy continues to accelerate, businesses can't afford slow training processes. AI-powered tools like Lupo aren’t just enhancing training—they’re revolutionizing it.</p><p>This LinkedIn newsletter will explore insights, stories, and practical strategies about:</p><ul><li><p>The future of AI in education and training</p></li><li><p>Democratizing knowledge through accessible technology</p></li><li><p>Practical tips for harnessing AI to enhance your L&amp;D efforts</p></li></ul><p>Join me on this journey to shape the future of knowledge sharing, powered by AI. Together, let's unlock the full potential of human expertise—at scale.</p><p>Hit <strong>Subscribe</strong> and let's dive into the future of learning together!</p><p>If you want to talk, just book some time with me: <a href="https://calendly.com/lupoai/xavier" target="_blank">https://calendly.com/lupoai/xavier</a></p></div>
