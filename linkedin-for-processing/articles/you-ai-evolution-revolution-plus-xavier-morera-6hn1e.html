  <div><p><em>A breakfast conversation, a bike ride, and the danger of thinking "good enough" is good enough.</em></p><p>This past week, I had one of the most meaningful conversations I’ve had in a while — over breakfast in Costa Rica, wearing tights. (Yes, nylon spandex — I had just biked 60 kilometers through morning traffic because sometimes you need a workout <em>and</em> a mindset shift.)</p><p>Across the table was a very successful CEO. Someone I admire. Someone who created a company,  changed the way in which companies used enterprise search, and then was acquired by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/accenture/">Accenture</a>. That's why I stopped mid bike ride, took this picture and wrote "almost there...". </p><p>We sat and talked about the changing business landscape and he raised a very important point, which turns out to be my main blocker when offer our AI-powered video creation platform to potential customers. </p><p>He had a name for it...</p><h3>Evolution, Revolution… and Revolution Plus</h3><p>What he told me is that he observed how many companies were used to traditional methods which cost thousands of dollars.  Some of the tools in the the traditional method evolved and have new AI-powered features, which is an "<strong>evolution</strong>" of their processes.</p><p>Then, with the help of a new wave of AI-powered tools, they've improved even further, and how with a combination of several tools they joined the <strong>AI revolution</strong> and significantly improved their productivity and decrease their costs.</p><p>They’re proud of what they’ve built — and they should be.</p><p>“It works,” he told me. And I agreed. It <em>does</em> work.</p><p>But then he said: “What if great was just one step beyond good — and came with less effort, not more?”</p><p>That question led us into a deeper conversation — not just about technology, but about mindset. About change. And about why so many organizations stop moving forward once things feel ‘better than before.’</p><p>Over the years, I’ve come to realize there are three stages of transformation when it comes to training and knowledge delivery:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Evolution</strong> is when you make your current process better. Maybe you digitize your PDFs. Swap live training for on-demand. Replace human narration with a script. It’s important — and it makes a big difference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Revolution</strong> is when you rethink how content is created and delivered altogether. You don’t just speed up; you restructure. You automate. You introduce AI. You reduce the human bottlenecks.</p></li><li><p>But then there’s <strong>Revolution Plus</strong> — where change doesn’t just increase capability, it <strong>removes friction</strong> entirely. It makes the complex feel simple. It scales without extra work. It opens up possibilities you didn’t even realize you were missing.</p></li></ul><p>That’s what I’ve built with Lupo. It’s not just a better way to create training videos — it’s a different way of thinking about the entire process of knowledge transfer.</p><p>And most people never get there. Not because they don’t want to — but because something else gets in the way.</p><h3>The Silent Innovation Killer: "Not Invented Here"</h3><p>There’s a mindset I run into more often than I’d like: <strong>Not Invented Here</strong> (NIH). It’s the quiet belief that unless something was developed internally, it can’t be trusted. It’s not “ours.” It’s not aligned. It’s not flexible enough.</p><p><strong>NIH </strong>is dangerous. </p><p>Because NIH:</p><ul><li><p>Slows you down while others are accelerating</p></li><li><p>Makes you rebuild things that already exist — just to prove you can</p></li><li><p>Keeps your team focused on protecting their turf instead of expanding their impact</p></li><li><p>Turns "innovation" into an internal branding exercise instead of a value creation engine</p></li></ul><p>I’ve seen organizations spend 10x the time and budget building in-house solutions — only to end up with something that does half as much and breaks under real usage. All because they couldn’t accept that someone else may have already solved the hard part.</p><p>May pride have a part in it? Maybe Dunning-Krueger? Maybe. That's for another day.</p><h3>Why “It Works” Is Often the Problem</h3><p>I say this with total respect: the greatest enemy of great is not failure — it’s <em>"it works."</em></p><p>When something works, we tend to stop. We protect it. We add a dashboard, an automation, a template… but we rarely question the entire foundation. After all, why mess with a system that’s delivering results?</p><p>Here’s why: because AI is moving faster than your processes. Because your customers and learners are changing faster than your training content. Because your team’s time is better spent solving problems, not formatting slides.</p><p>The real opportunity isn’t just to evolve. It’s to <strong>leap</strong> — and land somewhere completely different.</p><h3>A New Way to Transfer Knowledge</h3><p>With Lupo, we’ve made it possible to turn existing training content — slides, notes, transcripts — into professional-grade video with multilingual narration, automatic voice syncing, and consistent formatting. Not in days or weeks. In minutes.</p><p>And don't even get me started on everything else we can do.</p><p><strong>It’s not about doing what you already do, slightly faster. It’s about changing what’s possible entirely.</strong></p><p>So, I’ll ask you what my friend said over breakfast that every company should ask themselves:</p><blockquote><p>“Are we still evolving your process… or are we ready to revolutionize it — and then go one step further?”</p></blockquote><p>Whether you’re riding 60 kilometers through Costa Rican traffic or just navigating the demands of leading your team — that question matters.</p><p>The future belongs to those who don’t just accept change — but <em>embrace</em> it, <em>scale</em> it, and <em>accelerate</em> it.</p><p>– Xavier</p><p>Want to talk?
