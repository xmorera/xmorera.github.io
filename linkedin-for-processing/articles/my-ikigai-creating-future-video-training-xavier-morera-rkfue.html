  <div><p>We all have a calling and a mission. Mine is to create the future of video training.</p><p>About 20 years ago I started as an evangelist for this new thing called ".NET" for Microsoft and then traveled the world teaching people how to adopt 64-bit computing. Yes, I am "lucky" like that.</p><p>Since that time, I've always paid close attention to the process of teaching other people how to learn new skills or adopt new platform/technologies/languages.</p><p>Much has changed. There is less in-person training and video became the king of delivery mechanisms. </p><p>But while some problems have changed, there are several challenges that companies are currently facing, even with the plethora of available tools out there. </p><p>That's why I have made my mission to help create the future of video training.</p><p>Creating effective training videos should be simple—but in reality, it’s one of the <strong>most frustrating and expensive bottlenecks</strong> in learning and development.</p><p>I’ve spent over two decades working with companies like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> , <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/intel-corporation/">Intel Corporation</a> , <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudera/">Cloudera</a> , <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/joinmultiverse/">Multiverse</a> , <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pluralsight/">Pluralsight</a> , <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/accenture/">Accenture</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dhl/">DHL</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hewlett-packard-enterprise/">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</a>. </p><p>Some of these companies have figured it out, but many have not and that's where I’ve seen a common pattern: Organizations know that <strong>video training works</strong>, but <strong>they’re stuck</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>They have <strong>PowerPoints / Google Slides sitting idle</strong> because no one has time to narrate them or much less create the scripts.</p></li><li><p>They’ve recorded <strong>live sessions</strong> that are too casual or noisy to reuse.</p></li><li><p>They want consistent, branded, multilingual content—but can’t afford studios or voice actors.</p></li><li><p>Updating one video? That’s a <strong>2-week production cycle.</strong> Minimum.</p></li></ul><p>And so, great ideas stay stuck in folders. Internal expertise never reaches scale. And learning becomes a patchwork of half-finished efforts.</p><p>That’s why I founded <a href="http://Lupo.ai" target="_blank"><strong>Lupo.ai</strong></a>—to make <strong>video creation fast, scalable, and repeatable</strong>, using the content you already have.</p><p>Here’s how the platform helps solve the problems above:</p><hr><h3>AI Slides-to-Video</h3><p>Turn a narrated PowerPoint / Google Slides into a professional video—<strong>instantly</strong>. In fewer words, it creates the voice over but creating a video or entire course.</p><p>The content can also include recorded screen demos. No video editors. No cameras. Just upload and publish. This is Lupo’s core feature: you write, we produce. <em>(Oh and PDFs are coming soon)</em></p><hr><h3>AI Script Generation (PPTX)</h3><p>Have great slides but no voiceover? Lupo will write and insert AI scripts (narrations) for you—<strong>right into your slide deck notes section</strong>. Feel free to review the narrations and modify accordingly to suit your voice and style.</p><p>Start with content your team already understands, and let AI handle the delivery.</p><hr><h3>AI Transcripts (Animatics) </h3><p>This is a killer feature. Do you have an old recording with poor sound, awkward pauses, or off-script moments? Lupo extracts the script from the original video, lets you clean it up, and <strong>regenerates a crisp new version</strong> with professional narration and synced visuals.</p><p>It’s like re-filming your training, without ever hitting record again.</p><hr><h3>Premium Voices</h3><p>The voice is very important, that why we don’t just use any AI voices. We added premium narrations that are smooth, engaging, and available in over 70 languages. Because <strong>quality audio</strong> keeps learners focused—and makes your training sound like it was produced in a studio (even when it wasn’t).</p><hr><h3>Multilingual Videos</h3><p>You can create the content in one language and then create videos in <strong>any</strong> language. Do I need to say more? </p><hr><h3>The Result?</h3><p>You and your team can produce professional training content in hours—not weeks. You can scale your knowledge, reduce support tickets, and keep your training content up to date. You don’t need a media team. You just need Lupo.</p><p>If you’ve been stuck with content that never leaves your shared drive—just talk to me and turn your into something your whole organization can learn from. </p><p>That's why I called this newsletter, <strong>Knowledge Unleashed</strong>, because content sitting in your hard drive doing nothing is a waste.</p><p>I am Xavier, a learning and development passionate and Lupo is my Ikigai. My calling. The one thing that I love to do that helps other people. It is my little contribution to change the world and make it a better place.</p><p>Until next time. If you want to talk to me, send a DM or book some time: <a href="https://calendly.com/lupoai/xavier" target="_blank">https://calendly.com/lupoai/xavier</a></p></div>
