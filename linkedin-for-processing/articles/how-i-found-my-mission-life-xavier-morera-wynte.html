  <div><p>Not everyone believes in destiny, but I do believe we all have a mission on this planet. Some people find it early. Others never do. I was lucky enough to stumble into mine — by accident — and it changed my life. I have about 400 thousand learners in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pluralsightlearning/">Pluralsight</a> to show. Here's my personal story.</p><p>About 20 years ago, I was working at a company called <em>ArtinSoft (Artificial Intelligence Software, now part of </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/snowflakeeu/">Snowflake</a><em>)</em>. They built a platform that converted code from one programming language to another — a big deal back then (and still kind of is). We had a contract with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> to help them migrate from VB6 to <a href="http://VB.NET" target="_blank">VB.NET</a>.</p><p>I had three things going for me:</p><ul><li><p>I could code</p></li><li><p>I could explain what I was doing</p></li><li><p>I genuinely loved helping others</p></li></ul><p>That made me a good fit for Microsoft's Route 64 program (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoftlearn/">Microsoft Learn</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/intel-corporation/">Intel Corporation</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hp/">HP</a>), where I traveled the world teaching Microsoft partners how to adopt 64-bit computing. We didn’t just show up and present — we built the labs, delivered the sessions, and answered the hard questions.</p><p>It was the beginning of something I didn’t know I’d love so much: <strong>teaching technology to people in a way that makes sense</strong>.</p><p>That passion carried through the rest of my career:</p><ul><li><p>At <strong>Search Technologies</strong>, I built a search API for EY and led development on a massive patent processing system at CPA Global.</p></li><li><p>Along the way, I trained developers on Agile and Scrum almost every other week. (nod to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/scrum-alliance/">Scrum Alliance</a>) </p></li><li><p>Eventually, I wrote to a company I’d heard of — <em>Pluralsight</em> — and said, “Hey, I’m already teaching this stuff. Want me to record it?”</p></li></ul><p>That first course on Scrum and JIRA turned into another… and another… and now I’ve published over 50 courses for over 400,000 learners (just on Pluralsight alone).</p><p>I also worked for five years at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudera/">Cloudera</a>, and about seven years as a vendor for Microsoft.</p><p>And throughout all of that, I noticed something:</p><p><strong>Training people is slow, expensive, and hard to scale.</strong></p><p>Especially when it’s instructor-led:</p><ul><li><p>Endless flights</p></li><li><p>Weeks away from home</p></li><li><p>Jet lag, bad food, and 80 extra pounds later… I knew something had to change</p></li></ul><p>But that wasn’t the only issue.</p><p>Creating <strong>video training</strong> also has its problems:</p><ul><li><p>Not everyone’s good at it</p></li><li><p>It takes forever to record and edit</p></li><li><p>Updates are a nightmare</p></li><li><p>Everyone does it differently, so quality is inconsistent</p></li></ul><p>So I thought:</p><blockquote><p>“What if we could take everything I’ve learned — as a developer, instructor, content creator, and problem-solver — and build a platform that made training 10x easier and faster?”</p></blockquote><p>That’s why I created <a href="http://Lupo.ai" target="_blank"><strong>Lupo.ai</strong></a>. It is the result of tools that I've been creating for years for Pluralsight plus Cloudera's NGPS-inspired workflow.</p><p>Now, I know there are plenty of video AI platforms out there — <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/synthesia-technologies/">Synthesia</a> , <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/vyond/">Vyond</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/colossyan/">Colossyan</a>, and others. Great tools, but here’s the thing:</p><p>I didn’t build a company that creates videos. </p><p>I built a platform that solves training. I am not doing <strong>edu-tainment</strong>. I enable <strong>AI-assisted education</strong>!</p><p>There’s a difference.</p><p><strong>I did not found a company that creates videos</strong>.</p><p><strong>I founded a company that solves training.</strong></p><p>Lupo isn't just about video generation. It’s about <strong>accelerating knowledge transfer</strong> at scale — with:</p><ul><li><p>Smart automation</p></li><li><p>AI-powered workflows</p></li><li><p>Enterprise-ready publishing tools</p></li><li><p>Localization, versioning, and updates that don’t suck</p></li></ul><p>And it works because it was built by someone who’s lived the pain of training — in every format, industry, and continent.</p><p>This isn’t a startup story. It’s a mission. One that started with a line of VB6 and a room full of confused developers. And it keeps going.</p><p>If you’re trying to scale partner, customer, or employee training — I’ve probably faced the same problem you’re dealing with right now. </p><p>And I have a vision for the future where we have our own personal AI-tutor, but that's the meat and potatoes of a different edition.</p><p>Let's talk, exchange ideas, and help each other improve the world. </p><p><strong>Let's ride this wave of AI into the future.</strong></p><p>Talk to me: <a href="https://calendly.com/lupoai/xavier" target="_blank">https://calendly.com/lupoai/xavier</a></p></div>
