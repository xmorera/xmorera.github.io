What about Descript? Here's what they say: "Make Videos, Podcasts & Short Clips For Social Fast With Descript's Powerful AI Tools."
Here is how Descript works:  You record your content (a course, a coaching session, a talk), and Descript transcribes everything. From there, you just delete or change words in the transcript — and the audio/video updates in real time.
It also lets you clone your voice (Overdub), enhance audio (Studio Sound), remove filler words, and patch content without re-recording.
It's powerful. Good for polishing human-recorded content.
Just like Lupo, you need content to start with. Descript is a post-production tool — not a training content generator.
In that sense it does a similar thing to what we do at Lupo. We also take the content and create a video, but more than video we create an entire course.
We built Lupo from the point of view of a curriculum developer, not a marketing or social tool.
We kind of see it this way:
Descript is where you fix training videos.
Lupo is where you create them.
Both are valuable — depending on where you’re starting.
Would love to hear how others are combining creation and editing tools in their learning workflows.
Are you a Descript-first or AI-from-scratch type of team?
