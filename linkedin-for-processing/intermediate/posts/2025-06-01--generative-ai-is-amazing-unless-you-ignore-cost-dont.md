Generative AI is Amazing... Unless You Ignore Cost → Don’t
How would you react to a 1 million dollar bill? I have a story to tell you.
Generative AI offers unbelievable power—hyper-personalization, intelligent assistants, and provides capabilities only thought of in science fiction. But there’s a growing risk many teams overlook: unchecked usage costs. In a world of autoscaling and seamless integration, financial surprises can be just one misconfigured API call away.
Everyone hates a surprise when it comes to cost. Even worse, a big-enough surprise can bankrupt and kill your company.
Let me tell you a quick story of such an unexpected surprise that I once witnessed. A simple cloud automation failed quietly in an Azure production site, and it went unnoticed. The result? A jump from $4K to over $130K per month in infrastructure costs. The result was not pretty and it ended up killing the project.
That was then—but now, I see the same pattern emerging in Gen AI applications. A chat loop that runs too long, overusing a powerful model for every interaction, failing to cache results... these missteps can silently generate enormous expenses.
I want to help and make an impact on the developer community on this matter.
That's why I’m developing a course for Pluralsight called Effective Cost Management for Generative AI, aimed at helping practitioners understand and prevent exactly these kinds of surprises.
I want to hear your experiences. Have you hit unexpected AI or cloud costs in your projects? Leave a comment or reach out—your story might help someone else avoid the same mistake.
