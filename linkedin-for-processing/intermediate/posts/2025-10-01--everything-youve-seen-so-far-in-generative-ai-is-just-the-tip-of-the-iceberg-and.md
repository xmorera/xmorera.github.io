Everything you’ve seen so far in Generative AI is just the tip of the iceberg - and there’s a chance you are using the wrong tools!
There’s a vast, vibrant world of tools, platforms, and frameworks that goes way beyond ChatGPT and DALL·E.
Even worse, chances are you are using the wrong tool for the job!
I’ve spent the last few months exploring the ecosystem, and let me tell you—it’s overwhelming, exciting, and full of surprises.
From foundational models like GPT, Claude, and Gemini to orchestration frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex. From image generation wizards like MidJourney and Stable Diffusion to AI-powered automation via Zapier and RPA platforms. There are agents, copilots, voice clones, knowledge assistants, governance tools, and even AI tools for generating websites from a single prompt.
And this is just scratching the surface.
Over the next few weeks, I’ll be diving into this world. Not with abstract theory, but with hands-on explorations of what these tools do, why they matter, and how they fit together.
If you’ve ever felt lost in the AI tool jungle, this series will help you find your path—and maybe spark a few ideas along the way.
Stay tuned.
I'm Xavier, building a smarter world by merging AI, education, and video which you can use to reskill your workforce in this new age of AI.
