Most teams want the same two things this year: increase revenue and reduce costs.
For years, I used to say that my ideal company would be somewhere between 15 and 25 people and that we would scale on servers, not headcount.
What I did not fully account for was the staffing side: every new project, campaign, or experiment quietly demanded more people, coordination, and management.
Now, with AI, you have the capability to build digital co-workers instead.
Here is what finally clicked for me:
1) Tools should remove friction first.
Speed matters more than sophistication. If it still feels heavy, it will not get used.
2) Writing clarity drives most outcomes.
Whether you write it yourself or with AI, clear words move sales, marketing, and projects forward.
3) Automation saves more than time.
It saves attention and energy, which are much harder to replace than hours.
4) Knowledge needs one home.
Scattered notes and files quietly slow every decision.
5) Meetings fail without capture.
If no one remembers what was decided, work stalls and opportunities are lost.
Now, connect this to revenue.
One of the most powerful ways to win customers is to clearly showcase your products and services. Today, that usually means video: explainers, demos, testimonials, feature launches. Great video builds trust, shortens sales cycles, and keeps working for you long after it is published.
The problem is that traditional video production is slow and expensive.
This is where AI and automation come in. With tools like
lupo.ai
alongside a simple AI stack for writing, notes, and follow-ups, you can:
• Turn ideas and rough notes into scripts and storylines
• Generate on-brand videos for campaigns, product education, and sales enablement
• Produce multiple versions for different audiences and channels without starting from scratch
Instead of hiring a bigger team just to keep up with content, you use digital co-workers and automation to get more impact from the people you already have.
Growth is still hard work.
But it does not have to be manual work.
Where does friction slow your revenue engine the most today: writing, video, follow-ups, or something else?
