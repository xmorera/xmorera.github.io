How One App Went From $4K to $100K/Month—And What You Can Learn From It
Generative AI is revolutionary—but it can also quietly blow a hole in your budget.
I’ve seen it happen firsthand. An app is working well, gets rave reviews, it scales, and then the monthly bill jumps from $4,000 to $80,000.
Then $100,000. No one noticed until the end-of-year invoice hit nearly a million dollars.
And this wasn’t a one-time oversight. It was a structural problem.
That’s why I created my new course: Effective Cost Management for Generative AI.
I walk through real-world examples and practical techniques to:
- Uncover hidden cost drivers in GenAI systems
- Optimize model selection to avoid overspending
- Forecast and manage token and infrastructure expenses
- Apply prompt engineering, caching, and context summarization
- Balance simplicity, control, and scalability through smart platform decisions
The result? Applications that are just as powerful, but much more cost-effective.
The course takes you from sudden budget spikes to sustainable GenAI strategies. It covers:
- Model cost comparison and tradeoffs
- Token usage and prompt efficiency
- Cost monitoring and alerting best practices
- Financial operations \(FinOps\) for AI teams
This is for anyone building real-world AI solutions that need to scale without surprise invoices.
