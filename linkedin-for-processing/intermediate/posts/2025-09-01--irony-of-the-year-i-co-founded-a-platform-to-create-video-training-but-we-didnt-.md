Irony of the year: I co-founded a platform to create video training… but we didn’t have proper training for our own users.
We had plenty of individual videos and documentation, but not a structured learning path. The shoemaker’s son goes barefoot, right?
So we decided to fix that—and do it fast. We created a course called AI-Assisted Video Training Generation with Lupo AI, which we just released on Udemy.
A couple of things to know:
1. We built it very quickly, so the quality isn’t perfect.
2. That’s intentional. One of Lupo’s biggest strengths is that you can update content anytime, iterating as you go.
This is exactly what we’re doing. We launched a rapid first version, and we’ll keep improving it until it becomes a polished course that helps anyone create the content they need.
The course is free. Come check it out — and let us know what you think.
