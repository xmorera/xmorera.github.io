English is good, but localizing videos is a must. If you need to translate your videos, read this.
I’ve been exploring how companies handle localization, and one tool that came up was Phrase — a strong Translation Management System for text-based content like UI strings, websites, and documents.
So I decided to check how TMS work and determine if Lupo could be used to solve this problem.
Turns out it can be used. Some details are still work in progress, but it solves several problems in a very good way as it can take existing videos and finish up with a translated video quickly, saving a lot of time and for a very reasonable cost.
Let me talk about the the challenge. In 2025, content isn’t just text. Product onboarding, customer training, and internal communications are happening in video — and that’s where most TMS tools stop short.
Phrase is great for managing translations, but it doesn’t extract transcripts from existing videos, generate AI voiceovers in multiple languages, or create localized video versions in minutes.
That’s exactly where
Lupo.ai
steps in. We combine translation workflows with automated video and narration generation so you can:
Localize a training video in 40+ languages without re-recording.
We are also working on how to keep terminology consistent by using your own glossary or knowledge base.
Update videos instantly when products or processes change.
Here’s how it works:
1. Upload your existing video to AI Transcripts (Animatics) — Lupo extracts the narration and builds a PowerPoint (.pptx) version of the content.
2. Review translated text — currently a one-step process, soon to be almost fully automated, with your terminology baked in.
3. Upload the translated file to AI Video Generation — Lupo automatically creates a localized video with native-sounding narration in the target language.
Imagine going from “new feature released” to “multilingual video ready to share” in the same day. That’s not a dream — that’s
Lupo.ai
.
If localization is part of your work, I’d love to show you how Lupo can unify your text and video workflows — saving time, cost, and headaches.
If localizing videos is what you need, let’s connect and set up a quick demo:
