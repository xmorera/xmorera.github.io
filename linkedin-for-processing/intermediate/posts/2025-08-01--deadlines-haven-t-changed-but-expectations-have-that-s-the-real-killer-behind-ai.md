"Deadlines haven't changed, but expectations have". That's the real killer behind "AI is going to take my job".
A few days ago I had a meeting with a photographer who used to work in Amazon, taking pictures of products while placing them in "image-worthy" locations. That job is no longer there, as using AI it is possible to create an entire campaign from the comfort of your couch.
Now you may be expected to create a visual campaign, but in a day and with a much much (did I say much?) smaller budget.
That's why in this
Pluralsight
course, Image Generation with
OpenAI
ChatGPT, I show you beyond how to create an image.
Instead, I show you how to think in order to create the best image possible and how to refine your image, until you meet  expectations.
Go ahead, watch this course. and meet those deadlines with the added expectations!
