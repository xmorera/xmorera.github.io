Most companies don’t have a training problem — they have a knowledge transfer problem. Let's talk about the hidden cost of communication that can be solved with training.
Every time a product update doesn’t get shared clearly…
Every time a new hire learns by guessing…
Every time a partner misrepresents your offer…
You pay for it — in delays, rework, churn, and missed opportunity.
In fact, poor communication costs large enterprises an average of $62.4M per year in productivity losses.
The root cause? Knowledge is scattered, outdated, or locked in someone’s head.
Meanwhile, your teams — and your customers — move faster than ever.
They expect clear, accessible, up-to-date guidance. Most training systems can’t keep up.
Here’s what’s really at risk when knowledge doesn’t scale:
1. Slow onboarding: new hires and customers take too long to ramp up.
2. Low adoption: products go unused because no one knows how.
3. High support load: basic questions flood your helpdesk.
4. Employee churn: people leave when they feel lost or unsupported.
5. Inconsistency: one process, 20 different ways of doing it.
Modern leaders don’t just need more training — they need a system that continuously captures, distributes, and updates knowledge at scale.
One that integrates with how people actually work.
One that’s measurable.
One that removes friction — not adds more.
We’ve been thinking a lot about how companies can operate without reinventing the wheel every quarter.
