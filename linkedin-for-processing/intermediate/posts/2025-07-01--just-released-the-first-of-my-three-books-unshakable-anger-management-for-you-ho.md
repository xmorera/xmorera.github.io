Just released the first of my three books: Unshakable: Anger Management for You: How to Control Anger, Master Emotions, and Stay Calm in Chaos
If you get angry often—and don’t have much time to read—this is your book.
Anger doesn’t mean you’re broken. It means you’re human. But if left unchecked, it can derail relationships, cloud judgment, and rob you of peace.
That’s why I wrote Unshakable. It’s a no-fluff, fast-read guide to help you regain control when the world pushes your buttons.
Inside, you’ll find:
- The science behind emotional reactions—and how to override them
- Techniques to pause, breathe, and respond with intention
- Tools to stop being hijacked by others’ actions
- Everyday habits to build real emotional resilience
This book was born from personal experience and countless conversations with people under pressure. If you’re looking for practical tools to master your emotions and stay calm in chaos, I hope Unshakable helps you do just that.
Now available on Amazon, both:
- Kindle:

- Paperback:

Read it in a few hours—use it for a lifetime.
You don’t need to be perfect.
Just be unshakable.
PD: Yeap, I am a computer programmer, founder, and learning & development passionate professional. But I am also a flawed human in search of how to become a person, and in the process I want to help others in areas aside from technology with what I learned. That's why I am writing  a three part series: Unshakeable (anger), Unfatting Myself (Health and Nutrition), and Unwasting Time (Productivity). Hope you enjoy what I am creating.
