Nobody Gets Fired for Hiring
IBM
(or
Synthesia
)… But Here’s Why You Should Hire LupoAI instead.
We’ve all heard the saying, “Nobody gets fired for hiring IBM.” In the world of AI-driven content creation, Synthesia often feels like that safe choice  (or

...)—it's big, it’s established, and it works well. But sometimes, being the "number two" has its own unique advantages. Just like
Avis Rent a Car
once said: “We try harder” (
Hertz
was #1). Lupo is here to show you that being a smaller company means we can offer something truly special.
1. Personalized Service and Flexibility
At Lupo, we adapt to your workflow, not the other way around. Need a specific feature? You have a direct line to the founder. We listen, adapt, and deliver quickly, ensuring that you get the best possible experience.
Smartsheet
asked for a way to create storyboards and we created our Animatics feature.
Accenture
needed some translations, and we delivered our Transcripts feature.
2. Agility and Innovation
As a smaller company, we move fast. While larger platforms might have longer development cycles, we’re constantly innovating, always looking for ways to improve and stay ahead of the curve. With Lupo, you’re not just getting a product; you’re getting a partner in innovation.
The things I mentioned on #1? In a matter of a couple of days.
3. Direct Support, Collaboration, and Guidance
When you choose Lupo, you’re not just another client; you’re a valued partner. Our team is committed to providing personalized support, and you’ll always have a direct line to the founder. Don't believe me? Just book a spot with me:

We genuinely care about your success. And we are not only a platform. If you need additional help and guidance from concept to training 1000 humans with the effort of training 1, we are your company.
In the end, choosing Lupo means choosing a company that’s nimble, attentive, and ready to go the extra mile for you. Because sometimes, being the “number two” means we simply try harder.
