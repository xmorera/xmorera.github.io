(Lack of) Training is the silent killer of performance (and revenue).
If your customers/teams aren’t trained, your products/tools don’t matter. Most companies realize this too late — after low adoption, lost customers, or costly rework.
I’ve spent 22 years in software development, and no matter where I go, I keep circling back to the same bottleneck: training. That’s why I built
Lupo.ai
— an AI-powered platform that turns your content into high-quality training videos in minutes. It helps you ship faster, reduce costs, and scale learning across teams.
I’m currently available for contract work as a curriculum developer or training creator. I bring not only two decades of experience but also a powerful toolset that simplifies production and increases impact.
If you need help turning content into effective, engaging training — whether for employees, customers, or partners — I’d love to talk.
Message me here or tag someone who could use a hand with training.
Let’s build something valuable together.
I've already worked in many projects with companies like
Microsoft
,
Cloudera
,
Multiverse
,
DHL
,
Intel Corporation
,
HP
,
SMART Technologies
as well as course creation with
Pluralsight
.
I guarantee you will love what we do and will be satisfied with the results!
