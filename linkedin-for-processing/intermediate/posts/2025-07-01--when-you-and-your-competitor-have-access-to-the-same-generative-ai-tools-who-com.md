When you and your competitor have access to the same generative AI tools, who comes out on top? Spoiler alert: It’s the one who uses them more creatively and efficiently.
And the gap is gonna be thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis big (see the post image!)
Let me tell you a quick story and help you see the future in a different way.
Recently, I had the chance to share my thoughts on this during an interview with Microsoft Reactor, where we explored what it means for AI-first companies to thrive in a world where everyone has the same tools.
My take? Once the playing field is leveled, the real differentiator is productivity.
Let me give you a concrete example from my own workflow with Lupo. When I record demos, I start with a rough draft of the narration. Instead of spending hours refining it manually, I run it through Lupo’s AI transcript feature. This allows me to transform that rough draft into a more precise, information-dense script in a fraction of the time. The end result? A polished, high-quality recording that still sounds authentically human.
But it’s not just about the tools — it’s about the creativity and ingenuity you bring to them. For instance, one team might use AI to draft a blog post and publish it as is, while another team uses that same draft as a starting point, adding a unique narrative, humor, and visual elements that capture the audience’s attention. The difference in engagement is night and day.
The same goes for design. Two designers might start with the same AI-generated logo, but one of them adds a custom hand-drawn element or a unique color palette that makes the final product stand out.
In a world where everyone has access to the same technology, it’s the human touch that makes all the difference. So, next time you’re using AI, remember: the magic isn’t just in the tool, but in how you use it.
