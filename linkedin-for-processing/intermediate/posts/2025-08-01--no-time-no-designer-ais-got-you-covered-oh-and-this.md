No Time? No Designer? AI’s Got You Covered. Oh and this
Pluralsight
course too!
We live in extraordinary times. As professionals, we’re no longer just coders, marketers, or analysts. We’re expected to be all of them—and more.
Deadlines haven’t changed. But expectations? They’ve multiplied.
That’s why I created this new course on Pluralsight: Creating, Refining, and Publishing AI Images in
OpenAI
ChatGPT.
Watch here:

You’ll learn how to go from a single natural language prompt to:
- Photo-realistic product shots
- On-brand visual campaigns
- Precise image editing (logos, backgrounds, even aspect ratios)
- Cohesive image sets for landing pages or presentations
- Ethically generated, production-ready visuals
No switching between tools. No design bottlenecks. Just one unified interface where text, image generation, editing, and refinement come together.
This course covers it all—from your first prompt to the final branded image, including prompt anatomy, ethical publishing, and scaling visual campaigns.
AI isn’t just a productivity boost. It’s a creative advantage.
I'm Xavier, transforming how we learn—one AI-powered course at a time.
