# I believe everyone comes to this world for a purpose.

I believe everyone comes to this world for a purpose.
Some people reach their full potential, while others spend their days waiting for the weekend to come.
For me, just passing by in life is not enough.
My purpose is to help people share what they know so they — and others — can achieve their full potential.
There’s a quote from
Aaron Skonnard
, the founder of Pluralsight, that says: “Talent is equally distributed around the world, but opportunity is not.”
That truth hits me deeply. It means there are people out there with powerful insights, life-changing advice, and knowledge that could transform others’ lives — if only they had the chance to share it.
That’s why I’m building
Lupo.ai
. A platform designed to give anyone the opportunity to share their knowledge and create impact, for themselves and for others.
If I can just make a 10% difference as of what Aaron did, I can consider it a success as few people change the world like he did with video training.
That's why I am sharing my story as part of my build in public series, so that you can join me in my quest to democratize knowledge transfer.
