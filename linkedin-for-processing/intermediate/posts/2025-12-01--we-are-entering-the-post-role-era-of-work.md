# We are entering the post-role era of work.

We are entering the post-role era of work.
For decades, talent strategy revolved around a simple question: build or buy?
Do we train people for a role, or hire someone who already fits it?
That logic no longer holds.
Generative AI is dismantling jobs at the task level. Roles are no longer stable containers of work. They are fluid, continuously reshaped by what can be augmented, automated, or redesigned altogether.
The real question today is not:
“Who should we hire for this role?”
It is:
“For this task, should we augment a human with AI, automate it entirely, or acquire a scarce capability from the market?”
This is where the idea of a “skillforce” emerges.
Work is no longer organized around job titles, but around capabilities, adjacencies, and speed to proficiency. The atomic unit is not the role—it is the task.
Most organizations say they are becoming skills-based.
Few actually are.
Why?
Because they are drowning in data instead of making decisions.
Skill libraries, taxonomies, dashboards—none of them matter unless they answer one practical question:
What is the shortest, most reliable path from the skills we have today to the capabilities the business needs next?
That insight changes everything.
It turns HR from a reporting function into a scenario-planning function.
But even that is not enough if it stays in HR.
The real leverage point is the frontline manager.
If managers only see data, nothing changes.
If they see decisions embedded in their workflow, behavior shifts—from reactive backfilling to proactive capability planning.
Looking ahead, this goes even further.
As AI absorbs tasks, roles will continuously evolve.
Platforms will propose new role shapes, rebalance work across humans and machines, and match projects to internal talent dynamically.
At that point, HR is no longer maintaining structures.
It is orchestrating a living system.
Capabilities, not jobs, become the organizing principle.
If you lead talent, HR, or transformation:
Are you still designing for roles—or are you already designing for tasks?
