What if you could train 1,000 people with the effort of training just one?
That’s not just a catchy line—it’s what we do at Lupo for the medical industry worldwide.
As medical device manufacturing booms, so do the challenges: thousands of new hires, changing processes, multilingual needs, and tight compliance standards like ISO 13485 and FDA 21 CFR 820.25.
Traditional training can’t keep up—it’s expensive, slow, and risky.
That's why I founded
Lupo.ai
. We’ve reimagined training:
✅ Turn SOPs and slides into narrated videos in minutes
✅ Update instantly when things change
✅ Train in multiple languages—at scale
✅ Reduce errors, deviations, and costs
✅ Ensure audit-ready, standardized training across sites and shifts
The result?
• 70% less time and cost per training cycle
• 95% ROI within months
• Safer patients, better-prepared employees
We’re proud to support the medical industry—not just in Costa Rica, but globally—with scalable, AI-powered learning that puts quality and speed first.
If you’re in MedTech and want to see how we can help you scale training without growing your team, book a free meeting from my LinkedIn profile. And we are a @Microsoft partner, so you can access our platform via the Azure Marketplace.
Let’s make training an advantage—not a bottleneck.
