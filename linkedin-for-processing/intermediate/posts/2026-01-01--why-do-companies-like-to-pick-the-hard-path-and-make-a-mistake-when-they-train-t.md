Why do companies like to pick the hard path and make a mistake when they train their employees?
Wait, what? Well, they train their workforce using the old traditional methods, which is effective but not the best way.
Instead they should choose video training.
Why?
Not because it’s trendy. Let me tell you my experience because I have lived the pain of every other option.
For years I created training the “traditional” way: slides, long documents, scattered PDFs, in-person sessions that did not scale. Then I moved into video training and later into AI-driven video training. That experience completely changed how I think about learning.
When people ask me: “What are the key elements of effective learning?” this is how I answer.
1. Start with a clear change you want to see
Learning is not about content; it is about change.
What do you want people to do differently 30 days after the training? If you cannot answer that in one sentence, the rest is just noise.
2. Know exactly who you are teaching
A great course for a senior engineer can be terrible for a new hire.
Role, context, prior knowledge, constraints — all of that shapes how you design the experience. The same topic may require a different path for sales, support, or engineering.
3. Choose the right medium (this is where video wins)
If your goal is to scale, standardize, and repeat learning, video is usually the best starting point.
With video you can:
- Show, not just tell
- Capture the “how” and the “why” once, then replay it thousands of times
- Keep a consistent message across teams, regions, and time zones
- Blend demos, storytelling, and visuals in a way text alone rarely matches
You can always add documents, exercises, and discussions around the video, but the core explanation is reusable and reliable.
4. Build systems, not hero efforts
A single brilliant workshop is nice, but it does not build capability.
You need systems: tools to create content, platforms to deliver it, and ways to track who watched what, when, and with what impact. When you have a repeatable system for producing video training, you stop reinventing the wheel for every new topic.
5. Close the loop with feedback and iteration
Learning is never “one and done.”
Watch how learners actually use your videos, ask where they get stuck, measure performance before and after. Then update the content. Small, continuous improvements to your video library often beat big, sporadic training projects.
In short: define the change, understand the learner, use video as your primary medium, support it with solid systems, and keep iterating.
If you get those elements right, learning stops being an event and becomes a sustainable advantage.
How are you using video training today to turn learning into a system in your organization?
