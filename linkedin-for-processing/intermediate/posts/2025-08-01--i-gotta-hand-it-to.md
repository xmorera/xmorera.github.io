I gotta hand it to
Pictory
, that they make creating videos easy, and videos that look good.
But the question is, what kind of videos?
TL;DR; Pictory is great for fast, standalone explainer videos — but for professional course creators building scalable, pedagogically sound training, it lacks the infrastructure, interactivity, and insight required.
Paste a script, choose your visuals, pick a voice, and in minutes you have a narrated video with captions, background music, and a polished look.
For creators, marketers, and educators making short-form content, it’s a fantastic solution.
Blog post → video? Marketing copy → explainer?
Done. Fast. No editing experience needed.
But when you shift from content creation to training at scale, the needs start to change.
Things like:
- Course structure
- Consistency across modules
- Collaboration with SMEs
- LMS compatibility
And keeping the cost per minute down when you're doing this at volume
That’s where
Lupo.ai
steps in.
We’re not trying to replace tools like Pictory — we’re building for a different outcome.
Not just video, but training.
From a single slide deck, we generate entire structured courses — with narration, pacing, branding, and pedagogical consistency.
If you’re a coach, a training lead, or anyone building programs that grow people (not just views), this might be what you’ve been missing.
Pictory is great for quick content.
Lupo is built for scaling knowledge.
Curious — what are you using today to convert expertise into scalable learning
