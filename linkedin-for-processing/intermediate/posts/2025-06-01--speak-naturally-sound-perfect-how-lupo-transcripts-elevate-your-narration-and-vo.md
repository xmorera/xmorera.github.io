Speak Naturally, Sound Perfect: How Lupo Transcripts Elevate Your Narration and Voiceovers with AI
Say it right—even if you didn’t the first time.
Recording a demo or presentation isn't always easy. Sometimes you're in a noisy environment. Sometimes your narration doesn't quite hit the mark. And for many, speaking in English isn't second nature, making it harder for learners to fully grasp what's being shared.
That’s why we built Lupo AI Transcripts (Animatics).
With this feature, you can:
1. Record your presentation in your natural voice, regardless of accent or imperfections.
2. Get a full, editable transcript of your narration.
3. Clean up filler words, refine your message, or rewrite parts of the narration entirely.
4. Use the updated script to recreate your video with professional AI voiceovers using our Slides-to-Video feature.
5. Even better? You can translate the improved narration into other languages to reach a broader audience.
It’s a game-changer for educators, creators, and teams who want to share knowledge with clarity and precision—no matter how they sound the first time.
