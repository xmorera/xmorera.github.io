There is a phrase that goes "you can't compete with Bono", with
Synthesia
being Bono in this case. However, there are reasons where you might want to consider using
Lupo.ai
instead, let me tell you why.
Synthesia is one of the best tools out there for creating professional-looking videos with AI avatars. In Spanish we would say "manda huevo!", as they've received over a hundred million dollars in VC funds.
With all these cash, aside from their mega marketing and sales, they built a platform where you type a script, choose an avatar, pick a language — and you get a polished, on-brand video, fast.
It’s ideal for things like:
- Marketing explainers
- Company updates
- Multilingual internal comms
- Basic training videos
- And if what you need is a great-looking talking-head video, Synthesia nails it. (I don't like avatars, in IMHO it crosses a line but who am I to tell others if they should or should not use AI generated humanoids)
But here's the catch: when your goal is to build a complete, structured training program, things change.
Training isn’t just video — it’s consistency, pedagogy (andragogy), scaling, and keeping costs in check over time.
That’s where
Lupo.AI
comes in, as we built this platform as reflection of our real world curriculum-development process.
Lupo isn’t trying to replace Synthesia. We’re focused on something different:
Turning your existing content and knowledge into complete, AI-generated video courses — in minutes, in a standardized, collaborative, cost-effective, repeatable, and efficient way.
No avatars, no frills. Just fast, affordable, structured learning content that actually scales.
If you’re building courses, onboarding new hires, documenting repeatable processes, or rolling out customer training… Lupo might be the better fit.
It’s not about looking the flashiest.
It’s about getting high-quality training out the door — fast.
Would love to hear how others are balancing production value vs. scalability when it comes to training content.
