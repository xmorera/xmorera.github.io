Ok, where did I cross the line? Putting hair on me or the liver king fake abs? (Yeah, I know it is Linkedin, not Instagram!)
Point is that I am excited to share that I just published a course on image generation with Midjourney in Pluralsight, which you can watch here:

Image generation is more than just fun — it’s becoming a core skill in modern content creation. Whether you're working in marketing, education, design, or even product development, the ability to generate visuals on demand opens up a world of possibilities.
You can prototype ideas faster, visualize concepts without a designer, and personalize content at scale.
With tools like Midjourney, you don’t need technical or artistic training to get started — just your imagination and the right prompts.
In this course you will learn how to use generative AI (specifically Midjourney) to create stunning, useful, and occasionally hilarious images… like me in a wetsuit posing dramatically in absurdly fake abs, or sipping coffee mid-wave with a very calm co-surfer.
I will teach you:
- How to craft prompts that shape style, composition, lighting, and mood
- How to tailor AI-generated images for marketing, mockups, and content creation
- How to build your own collection of professional-grade visuals — no camera, model, or budget needed
Why I created it:
Because I love how generative AI removes friction from creativity. No fancy gear. No long photoshoots. Just an idea and a prompt. (And sometimes, a little too much imagination.)
Midjourney makes it easy.I’ll show you how.
And yes — all the images were AI-generated. No surfboards were harmed in the making of this course. The abs... no comments.
