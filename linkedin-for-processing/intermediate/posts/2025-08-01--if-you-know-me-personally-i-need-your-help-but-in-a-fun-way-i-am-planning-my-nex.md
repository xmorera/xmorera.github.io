If you know me personally, I need your help but in a fun way. I am planning my next newsletter for Knowledge Unleashed with AI (
https://lnkd.in/eixB7utA
), which tries to explain my purpose in life, which is around video training. This is not exactly easy! But it is a story I want to share. It is my story, which may help you too.
I made this post because if you know me personally and have something to that you would like for me to add, send me a note. I have until Tuesday to work on this post!
Oh and the image is me going against a wave, which in my life represents me going against the VC backed companies that are doing similar things that I do (
Synthesia
,
Descript
,
Vyond
,...). It is a big market and I think there is space for a small guy like me, because what I created is based on processes and workflows for creating (video) training that I learned from the best! Learning to surf at 47 is great!
Here is what I want to talk about:
- How I discovered what I love to do, that helps people (teaching) (we all have a purpose in life, but not everyone finds out what it is)
- How I started with the
Microsoft
route 64 and then traveled the world
- How I then did some development for Search Tech, including the search api for
EY
and other dev
- How I started with
Pluralsight
, because I kept doing the same training over and over again
- How that grew into now over 50 courses with around 400 000 learners
- Evolved into other engagments, additional things like
Microsoft
,
Multiverse
,
RightHub - From Anaqua
,
DHL
,
Accenture
, and
Cloudera
- Cloudera had a tool that I helped create, NGPS or next generation publishing system, which created PDFs for instructor led training. I got inspired on their worfklow
- I also started creating small tools around 2015 to speed up video production for
Pluralsight
, which evolved into a "works like a Swiss clock" video production process
- But here is the thing. Everywhere I worked, I noticed the same problems. Training people is expensive, especially ILT. All that traveling, time away from the family, planes, bad food (I have 80+ lbs gained while traveling to show)
- Oh and let's not focus on the hardships of creating video training. It is slow, recording is not easy, it is an ad-hoc process in the sense that everyone has a different take on it and don't even get me started on the updates
- All my experience as a curriculum developer and technical author lead to the founding of a platform to solve this problem.
I truly believe this is the purpose of my life, to make video training creation easy, fast and affordable for companies, be it to get their users to adopt their products/services (which increases revenue) or train their employees internally to increase their productivity, decreases errors, avoids reinventing the wheel and increases engagement (which saves money)
Now this is what I have planned.  Drop me a note or let's talk. I always like to spend time talking to people, especially those that I care about.
