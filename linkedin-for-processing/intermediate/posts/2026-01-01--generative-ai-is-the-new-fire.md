# Generative AI is the new fire.

Generative AI is the new fire.
When I think about the future my daughters are going to encounter and the role that AI will play in their lives, that is the closest analogy I can find: a powerful tool that can warm, illuminate, and accelerate progress – if we learn how to use it well.
I do not want my daughters to be passive users of this technology. I want them to use generative AI to improve their productivity and to create things they could have never imagined before. I want them to understand it, question it, and shape it.
That is why I believe they should learn generative AI – and so should you.
When you start exploring generative AI, it is easy to feel two things at once: excitement and overwhelm. So many concepts. So many tools. So much noise.
The way I think about it is as a learning roadmap:
1) Start with “What is Generative AI?”
Understanding how it fits into AI, machine learning, and deep learning already puts you ahead of most people.
2) Learn a few important concepts.
You do not need a PhD in math, but some intuition about probability, statistics, and vectors goes a long way.
3) Get hands-on with foundation models and tools.
ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama, image models, Python, LangChain, prompt engineering – these are the new everyday tools for knowledge workers.
4) Move from using tools to building workflows and agents.
Once you see that you can chain prompts, call APIs, and delegate tasks to AI agents, you start redesigning how you work instead of just working faster.
5) Keep learning with the right resources.
There is more high-quality content than ever, but you need a clear path, not random tutorials.
Why does all this matter?
Because generative AI is already reshaping how we write, code, research, analyze data, learn new skills, and design products. The people who know how to use it will help shape the future of their teams, their companies, and yes, the world our kids grow into.
That is why I am on a personal mission to democratize education with
lupo.ai
and through my Pluralsight courses: helping people move along this roadmap step by step and actually use generative AI in their daily work. Not just understand the theory, but turn it into practical skills they can apply immediately.
You do not need to master every part of generative AI to start.
You just need to take the next step.
Where are you right now on your generative AI learning roadmap, and what is the next skill you want to build?
