Expert systems work by representing the knowledge of an expert in a particular field and using this knowledge to solve problems that would otherwise require human expertise.
This knowledge is stored in the form of a knowledge base, which is a database of information that the expert system uses to solve problems. The knowledge base contains facts, rules, and relationships that describe the domain of expertise. 💯
The inference engine is the core component of the expert system and is responsible for using the knowledge base to make inferences and arrive at a solution. It uses a set of heuristics or strategies to make decisions and determine which rules should be applied in solving a problem.
The heuristics are designed to simulate the reasoning process of a human expert. ✅
