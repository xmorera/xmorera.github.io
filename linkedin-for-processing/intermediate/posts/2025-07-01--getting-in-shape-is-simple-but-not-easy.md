Getting in Shape Is Simple — But Not Easy!
Yeap, that's what I am explaining now when people ask me how did I make such a drastic transformation. You see, 2.5 years ago, I was 103 kg and 43% body fat. I was living in constant burnout, although I guess I got so used to it that for me it was just my life.
I didn’t change because of a health scare. It was actually accidental. My wife nicely asked me to join a cycling club, which I did... and ride after ride, I got dropped. One day I help a girl who fell and when she was asked who her savior was, she said "the fat guy in the Tesla".
Daaaaamn that one hurt. I can't tell you how much did I hate to be always the last one to finish. The one people waited for — or didn’t.
That’s when my competitive side kicked in. I started to lose weight to become faster, which I did. I kept training and learned about nutrition.
Today, I’m ~70 kg, ~15% body fat, and still riding — but now I ride with much faster people and way longer distances.
What made the difference?
- Structured indoor cycling (TrainingPeaks + Wahoo)
- Strength training 2x/week
- Higher protein, less junk but still a lot of carbs which is training fuel
- Daily tracking — even when it hurt
What you need to know is that the application of knowledge is the key to making informed decisions, solving real-world problems, and achieving meaningful goals. It transforms passive understanding into active impact, turning what you know into what you do.
Showing up even when I didn’t feel like it!
What I gained:
✅ Confidence
✅ Energy
✅ Focus
✅ Mental clarity
✅ A version of myself I hadn’t seen in years
Getting in shape is simple, but not easy.
That’s exactly why it’s worth doing.
