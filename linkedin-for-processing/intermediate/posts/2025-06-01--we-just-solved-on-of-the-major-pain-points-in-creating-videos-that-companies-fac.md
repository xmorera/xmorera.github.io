We just solved on of the major pain points in creating videos that companies face, the audio narration part. We did it using AI. Let me explain.
One of the biggest barriers to creating high-quality training or demo videos is audio. You need a good mic, a quiet room, editing skills—and even then, not everyone has a radio DJ voice.
We did it by creating a feature that we call "AI Transcripts (Animatics)", which solves three major challenges in video creation:
1. Audio quality – No more stressing about microphones or background noise.
2. Voice performance – Not everyone has a broadcast-ready voice, and that’s okay.
3. Multilingual delivery – Sharing content across languages shouldn’t require re-recording from scratch.
This feature takes any existing video with human narration, extracts the script, lets you edit the narration, and then regenerates the video using our AI Slides-to-Video engine with premium voices. It’s like giving your content a second life—cleaner, clearer, and more accessible to global audiences.
High-quality video, without high-effort audio.
It's not just overlaying a voiceover on top of the audio, we give you a way to enhance your narration.
