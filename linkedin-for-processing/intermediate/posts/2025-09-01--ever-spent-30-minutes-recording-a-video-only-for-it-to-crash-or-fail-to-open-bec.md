Camtasia isn’t rare—and it’s frustrating. You lose time, energy, and momentum.
At Lupo, we asked: Why should creating training videos feel like walking through mud?
With Lupo, you don’t need:
a.  Complex screen recorders
b. Audio editing skills
c. Codec troubleshooting
d. Or maybe even a mic (you might for some cases, but you don't need a radio DJ voice and a perfect script)
We built a platform where:
1. You drop in your content, be it PowerPoint, slides, or script
2. AI generates narration in multiple languages
3. Subtitles and timing are built-in or modifyable
4. You publish and scale—without ever hitting "render failed"
Lupo is how training should work in 2025.
Fast. Scalable. Frustration-free.
