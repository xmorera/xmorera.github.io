# Two things:

Two things:
1. Good to take training and learn. For me this is the cornerstone of moving ahead in life.
2. SCORM is good, but I like straight-shooter video like my Pluralsight trainings or
lupo.ai
content muuuch better! It makes it more engaging and easy to follow. (Don't shoot me for this unpopular opinion! Is it unpopular?)
