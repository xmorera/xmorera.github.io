Everyone has a story of how they started, with insights that can help others. That's why I decided to share my story of how I went from code Migration to Speaking to 1,500 People to having around 400 000 learners watched my video courses.
It all started years ago with a company called
ArtinSoft
—short for Artificial Intelligence Software. Even though it had AI in the name, in reality it was more of a pretty good proprietary language that created some abstract syntax trees, applied some rules, and auto-generate code in another language.
My job? Software migration. (Or comment out everything that does not compile at first, and then try to fix one by one the errors)
But here’s the twist: I found myself constantly helping others on how to use do we were working on. I was also the guy that raised his hand, asked questions, and explained things when we had to talk to
Microsoft
people. Makes me wonder what happened to Ed Robinson...
Then something unexpected happened. Because of my outspoken and participative nature, I was asked me to present.
First in Costa Rica, then in Mexico to 20 people. Then 50. Then Puerto Rico...
And then… 1,500 people.
Talk about a trial by fire intro into the public speaking world!
That’s how my speaking and training career was born—not from ambition, but from necessity and repetition.
It wasn’t planned, but it shaped everything that came after.
In the next post, I’ll share how this led me to the next phase: Microsoft.
And yes, it’s a story worth telling.
