Your learning journey is as unique as you are. Imagine a platform that doesn’t just teach you, but adapts to your curiosity at every turn. That’s exactly how Lupo came to life—from a dream of personalized learning that started with a simple idea called MLguru.
In 2022, I was inspired by those "choose your own adventure" books we loved as kids. I envisioned a learning platform that allowed users to build their own educational journey, exploring topics that interested them and adapting content to their unique learning needs.
We called it MLguru. The concept was simple yet powerful: readers could pick a topic like artificial intelligence, then choose their next steps—diving into machine learning, exploring computer vision, or reinforcing tricky concepts. Each choice generated the next piece of content, creating a truly personalized experience.
As we developed MLguru, we realized that adding on-demand video instructions could elevate the experience. We started building short, dynamic videos generated from simple text prompts. This evolution marked the birth of Lupo, transforming our initial concept into a dynamic, AI-powered platform that adapts to each learner’s journey.
Today, Lupo stands for that same vision: personalized learning experiences driven by AI, tailored to each individual's needs and interests. The future of education isn’t one-size-fits-all; it’s a journey you shape yourself, and we’re excited to be part of that adventure.
