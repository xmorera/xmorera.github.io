My story began on how I became a trainer started several years ago when I was working with a company called
ArtinSoft
.
Artinsoft stood for ARTificial INtelligence SOFTware. Quite a name for a company that was founded in 1993! They were a little bit ahead of the game!
Turns out that I was working on migrating software from one language to another. It was not actual AI, in reality, what they did was parse some code, built an AST (abstract syntax tree), applied some rules, and created the code in another language.
SEO success story: I was told that a
Microsoft
employee found them in a
Yahoo
directory, contacted them, tested the solution, and from what I was told, this ended up being a project in the 10s of millions–the biggest success story in Costa Rica for a software company that I am aware of.
When I was working with them, I always ended up explaining to other people the ins and outs of our work. So they sent me to one presentation here in Costa Rica, then another one, then they sent me to another presentation in Mexico, in front of like 20 people, then another presentation in Mexico again, in front of 50 people, then Puerto Rico, and then they sent me to a presentation with 1,500 people.
How's that for a warm-up to get in front of a large crowd? 1500 living and breathing souls!
The whole point is that that's how my career as a public speaker and trainer arised from from just a series of presentations.
But what comes next is the Microsoft phase, which is an interesting story.
Spoiler: Have you seen a grown man cry in a stall in Microsoft corp?
Let me tell you a little bit about it in the next post.
