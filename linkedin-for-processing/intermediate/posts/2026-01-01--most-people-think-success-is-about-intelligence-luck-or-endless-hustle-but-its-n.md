Most people think success is about intelligence, luck, or endless hustle… but it’s not.
Now that we’ve reached the end of the year, I’ve been thinking about how to improve my 2026, so here are my thoughts on what it takes to be successful.
In my experience, it’s mostly about one uncomfortable skill most people avoid until reality forces them to learn it too late:
Delayed gratification with structured discipline.
Here’s how I see it play out after years of building products, creating training, and now growing

1) People who succeed learn to sit with discomfort. People who stay stuck run from it.
They ship when it’s scary. They practice when it’s boring. They repeat the fundamentals when there’s no applause.
Those who stay stuck escape discomfort with entertainment, excuses, and distraction. Every hard thing is labeled “stress” and postponed.
2) People who succeed build systems. People who stay stuck rely on motivation.
Motivation is emotional. Systems are mechanical.
Successful people don’t wake up “in the mood.” They wake up inside a structure.
Those who stay stuck wait to “feel ready.” Failure loves people who wait.
3) People who succeed choose boring progress over chaotic excitement.
Repetition looks boring.  Consistency feels dry. Routine feels restrictive.  That’s why many avoid it.
But meaningful results are built in boring routines repeated long enough to compound.
4) People who succeed delay pleasure.
People who stay stuck delay responsibility.
The first group asks, “What must be done first?”   The second asks, “What will make me feel better now?”
That single difference often explains debt, regret, and stalled careers.
The skill that creates long-term success is not sexy.  It doesn’t trend. It doesn’t feel good at first.
But it quietly decides whether your goals will obey you or embarrass you for years.
If this exposed a habit you’ve been defending, pause. That discomfort might not be stress. It might be growth knocking.
What is one small system or routine you can commit to this week that future you will thank you for?
