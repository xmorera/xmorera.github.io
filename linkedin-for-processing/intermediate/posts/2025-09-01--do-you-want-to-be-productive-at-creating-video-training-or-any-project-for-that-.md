Do you want to be productive at creating video training (or any project for that matter?) Here is my secret to producing 50+ video courses for Pluralsight plus many more for others: Workflow.
If you want to consistently create quality training at scale, you need a system that works for you, not against you.
Behind every video course I’ve published, I use a standardized, effective, and "works-like-a-Swiss-clock" method.
It involves a Kanban board for project tracking and management, where each clip is a ticket. It keeps everything bite-sized and trackable.
I store all media assets in S3—raw recordings, edited clips, visuals. Easy to access, easy to sync with my video editor and developers.
GitHub holds all the non-media materials like code samples, scripts, and notes. This gives me history, versioning, collaboration, and traceability.
I collaborate closely with my editor using that same Kanban board, GitHub, and S3 bucket. We’re in sync at every step.
This system is how I’ve managed to keep momentum—not just once, but over dozens of courses.
There’s no magic. Just clarity, structure, and execution.
If you’re building training content, your process is your superpower.
I'm Xavier, passionate about scaling knowledge through training innovation.

PS: After 20+ years in L&D, 12 of which in video, and 7 years of tool development, I packaged all this up into

, a platform for creating video training using AI.
