22 years ago I started working for a company called ArtInSoft, which stood for Artificial Intelligence Software. I can say that they were quite ahead of their time, but AI winters aside, thanks to them is that I started my career as a software developer in the exciting world of learning and development.
I started with
Microsoft
(alongside
Intel Corporation
and
HP
), traveling the world with the Route64 initiative, where we trained MS partners how to adopt 64-bit computing.
Years passed and I developed or collaborated in many software projects (
CPA Global
,
EY
,
Cloudera
) as well as developing courses and materials for
Pluralsight
and others.
With all that experience and the tools that I created along the way, I founded
Lupo.AI
, with a mission to democratize knowledge transfer, through video.
Through the use of AI agents, we empower enterprises and SMBs with the ability to generate training without the need to record or edit. We are currently helping companies like
Accenture
,
DHL
,
Smartsheet
,
Vester Business
and others. Why not you too?
We are like a
Synthesia
,
Vyond
or
DScript IT
but built for the enterprise. We help companies increase their revenue or decrease costs with the help of our AI agents.
If you are curious or want to improve how you create training, just book some time with me:
