HeyGen
is another one of the "big ones" for content creation. But does that make it an education-focused platform? Let's see.
AI avatars. Voice cloning. 175+ languages. The ability to create a custom presenter from a single photo.
If you're producing dynamic, multilingual videos at scale — especially for marketing, onboarding, or internal comms — it's hard not to be impressed.
In fact, many companies use HeyGen to:
- Launch multilingual product promos
- Create personalized sales videos
- Localize short-form training content
- Replace real presenters with branded avatars
And it works.
The avatars are sharp. The interface is solid. The output is clean.
But when your priority shifts from content creation to course creation, the needs change.
That’s where
Lupo.ai
takes a different path.
We’re not trying to be everything for everyone.
Instead, Lupo is purpose-built to help teams turn their knowledge into full training programs — fast.
From your existing slide deck or document, we generate a cohesive, voice-narrated training video… in minutes.
No avatars, no distractions — just structured, scalable training content.
It’s less Hollywood, more Harvard.
And for teams rolling out consistent, high-volume training across products, regions, or roles — that focus matters.
Curious how others are navigating this space.
When it comes to training at scale, what do you value most: production flexibility, or process efficiency?
