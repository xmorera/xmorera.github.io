The output of an AI model is only as good as the prompt it receives.
If you’ve ever asked ChatGPT something… and gotten a mediocre answer, then join the club.
Prompt engineering isn’t about clever wording — it’s about understanding how large language models work, how to shape your queries, and how to take full advantage of tools like custom instructions, memory, multimodal inputs, and more.
I just released a new Pluralsight course:
“OpenAI: Prompt Engineering” — a hands-on, beginner-friendly walkthrough that will help you:
- Understand how prompting impacts output quality
- Navigate ChatGPT’s interface and key features (console, memory, tools)
- Use techniques like structured prompts, file uploads, and advanced data analysis
- Learn the real limitations of LLMs and how to work around them
It’s short — just over 30 minutes — and packed with examples you can apply right away.
If you're serious about boosting productivity and getting better results with OpenAI’s models, this course is for you.
