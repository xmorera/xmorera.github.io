Kudos to OpenAI for my new favorite feature, Deep Research.
AI can give us instant answers — but speed isn’t the same as depth.
In an age of one-click summaries and ChatGPT shortcuts, we risk mistaking surface knowledge for true understanding. But leaders, educators, and researchers know: insight doesn’t come from a fast answer. It comes from asking better questions, exploring multiple perspectives, and wrestling with nuance.
That’s why I’m excited about a shift I’m seeing — and using — with deep research powered by AI.
How it works:
Instead of asking AI for quick facts, I now structure it like I would a team of research assistants. I ask it to:
- Summarize opposing views
- Extract insights from long documents
- Compare policies or datasets
- Point out contradictions
- Build structured knowledge across sessions
It doesn’t replace thinking. It amplifies it.
The result? Faster insight. Higher quality output. And more time spent on decision-making — not data collection.
Why it matters in higher ed and beyond:
As we teach the next generation how to use AI, we can’t just teach prompting.
We have to teach process.
The goal isn’t just getting answers.
The goal is learning how to explore ideas with more depth, speed, and structure than ever before.
AI won’t replace critical thinking — but it will expose those who never developed it.
Let’s stop skimming. Let’s start digging deeper.
