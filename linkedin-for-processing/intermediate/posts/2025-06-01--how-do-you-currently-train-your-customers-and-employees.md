Training customers and employees effectively is one of the most powerful ways to drive adoption, reduce support costs, and increase satisfaction.
💠Over the years, I’ve worked with organizations of all sizes—from startups to global enterprises—and one thing is clear: everyone trains differently. Some rely on live sessions, others use video content or documents, and some still do it all manually.
So, I’d love to learn from you about your current training ways. Vote below or add a comment if your approach is different—I’d love to hear it.
