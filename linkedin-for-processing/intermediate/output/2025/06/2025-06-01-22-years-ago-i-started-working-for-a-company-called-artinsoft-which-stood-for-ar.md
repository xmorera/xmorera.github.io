22 years ago I started working for a company called ArtInSoft, which stood for Artificial Intelligence Software. I can say that they were quite ahead of their time, but AI winters aside, thanks to them is that I started my career as a software developer in the exciting world of learning and development.
I started with Microsoft (alongside Intel Corporation and HP), traveling the world with the Route64 initiative, where we trained MS partners how to adopt 64-bit computing.
Years passed and I developed or collaborated in many software projects (CPA Global, EY, Cloudera) as well as developing courses and materials for Pluralsight and others.
