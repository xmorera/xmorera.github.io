# Creating a Culture of Learning is No Longer Enough—And Videos Alone Won’t Get You There

Creating a culture of learning is no longer enough—and videos alone won’t get you there.
The real unlock is video plus AI agents that help you find what matters, answer questions, and turn content into something you can actually use. That's why we have expanded Lupo.ai as an LMS with interactive AI agents.
Today, organizations have more learning content than ever—courses, videos, recordings, documentation. Yet most of that knowledge goes unused. Not because people don’t care about learning, but because finding the right insight at the right time is still too hard.
This is where AI agents change everything.
AI agents turn learning from a passive experience into an active one. Instead of watching long videos or skimming endless resources, learners can:
- Ask questions and get instant answers
- Jump directly to the most important moments
- Learn at their own pace, guided by context—not timelines
Video is already the most powerful learning medium we have. But video alone isn’t enough. When combined with AI agents that understand content, surface insights, and guide learners, video becomes something entirely different: an interactive learning experience.
At that point, learning stops being a separate activity and becomes part of how work actually gets done.
A truly effective culture of learning isn’t built on more content.
It’s built on less friction, better guidance, and smarter use of AI.
This is the shift we’re focused on at Lupo—helping teams learn faster by turning video into something you can interact with, not just watch.
The future of learning isn’t just cultural.
It’s AI-powered.
