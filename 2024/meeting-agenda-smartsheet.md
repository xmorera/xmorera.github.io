# Taming the Monster: Conducting Successful Meetings by Creating an Effective Agenda

There is no doubt in anyone's mind that meetings are a necessary evil. 

On one hand, they are required for effective collaboration—despite of what that YouTube ad tells you... meetings are here to stay.

But on the other end they cna be a productivity killer and don't even get me started on the cost.

Just think about this. A 1 hour meeting is not one hour of lost productivity. If you have 8 people, then it is a full day of lost productivity plus the time it takes for all meeting-goers to get back into the grove of whatever they were working on.

Even worse, it feels like sometimes we go to meetings whose sole purpose is to plan for other meetings or worse than "worse".

You know what I am talking about. When someone creates a meeting just to "feel productive".

Well... things don't need to be this way. 

There is one way out: Creating an effective meeting agenda. 

In just a moment I'll show you the key components of a meeting agenda. Let me first tell you a few things you need to consider overall when in the process of scheduling and creating a meeting.

## Key Tips and Essential Components of a Meeting

1. Clearly define the meeting's purpose
Before you even start sending out invites, make sure that the objective of the meeting is clearly defined. Establish the goals and objectives of the meeting and make sure there is a clear way of determining the outcomes from said meeting.

2. Craft a clear and succinct agenda
List out each of the topics that need to be covered, including a brief description and time box. Make sure that you allocate a specific amount of time to each point in the agenda to make sure that there is time to cover everything. 

3. Prioritize ruthlessly
Not all topics are created equal. The items in the agenda should be ordered by priority, starting with the most important ones. Focus the agenda on the priority items. It is always possible to roll-over less important items to a follow up meeting.

4. Invite only necessary participants
Remember, for the company, a 1 hour meeting is not a 1 hour meeting. It is 1 hour multiplied by the number of people that attend. Be very clear of why each person is invited, which is easier done by linking each person to at least one point in the agenda.

5. Encourage participation
If a participant is invited to the meeting, he or she has something of important to contribute or help decide. Thus, encourage everyone to share their thoughts and ideas.

6. Assign roles and responsibilities
Just like the daily scrum has a scrum master, meetings should have an assigned facilitator that helps keep the meeting on track, make sure everyone has a chance to speak, and help capture key points and action items.

7. Actionable outcomes
One of the most important outcomes of any meeting should be actionable items. Each agenda item should ideally lead to a decision or assign tasks to specific individuals. Having this as part of the agenda not only ensures productivity but also holds people accountable for the meeting's outcomes.

8. Make time for Q&A
Even with a structured agenda, it’s important to leave some room for questions or open discussion toward the end of the meeting, which gives participants the opportunity to bring up concerns or insights that may not have been covered but are still relevant to the meeting’s objective.

Once you have defined the items outline above, you can now work on the agenda.

## Essential Elements of a Meeting Agenda
Every meeting agenda should include:
- Meeting title and date: 
Clearly identify the meeting and when it will take place.

- Attendees: 
List all invitees and their roles.

- Meeting Objectives: 
Outline the specific goals you aim to achieve by the end of the meeting.

- Discussion Topics: 
List each topic that will be covered, with a brief description and estimated time allocation.

- Action Items: 
Capture key decisions made and assign next steps with clear ownership and deadlines.

By following these tips and incorporating the essential elements, you can ensure your meeting agendas are clear, focused, and lead to productive outcomes.  

Remember, a well-crafted agenda can be the difference between a very expensive time-wasting session and a valuable collaboration tool.
