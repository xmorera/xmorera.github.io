For as long as I can remember I‚Äôve been susceptible to muscle cramps during exercise.
They‚Äôve ruined more races for me than rain has parades and I‚Äôve re-enacted the bedroom scene in The Exorcist on more nights than I‚Äôd care to admit. I once even lost a Chicken Tikka Masala to a ‚Äòsudden, involuntary, spasmodic contraction‚Äô of my hamstring that occurred during an otherwise uneventful post-race meal.
If you're in the same boat, we'd love to hear about your experiences in our 8th Annual Cramp Survey. It'll take ~4 minutes and help us further understand this race-ruining phenomenon...
TAKE THE CRAMP SURVEY
And, if cramp is still more of a thorn in your side than, well, thorns in your side, here are some thoughts and suggestions based on the latest science...
The Muscle Strikes Back
Despite the fact that exercise-associated cramps are so common and have been widely studied, no-one can fully explain them yet. A bit like Dark Matter, or Elon Musk‚Äôs ‚Äòtweets‚Äô.
In spite of this, whilst I still lose the odd battle, I‚Äôm largely winning my own personal War on Cramp these days. I‚Äôd put that down to modifying my behaviour, diet and what I expect of my body based on what I‚Äôve learned through a combination of research and experimentation.
So, if you're a fellow cramper, there may be hope for you yet.
Until very recently, there were essentially two main competing theories on what causes Exercise Associated Muscle Cramp. (Unless you count the conspiracy theory that it‚Äôs Chuck Norris‚Ä¶) 
The ‚ÄòNeuromuscular Theory‚Äô proposes that muscles tend to give you hell when they‚Äôre overworked and fatigued due to electrical misfiring. Sadly cramp evolved before the pandemic invented ‚Äòquiet quitting‚Äô.
This idea is well suited to being tested in a lab - where researchers can ‚Äòexcite‚Äô muscles with electrical stimuli (not as kinky as it sounds) and provoke muscle cramps to measure what‚Äôs happening at a neuromuscular level - and so there‚Äôs arguably more robust data to support it than other hypotheses.
Studies that have looked at the electrical activity of muscles have also shown increased baseline levels of activity in fatigued muscles between bouts of cramping. As if your muscles are firing away like my trigger happy son during a Battle Royale on Fortnite, even when they‚Äôre not spasming. This tends to suggest that fatigue is somehow stopping the muscle from relaxing.
One big thing that supports the neuromuscular theory is that stopping and stretching afflicted muscles is often an effective method for alleviating cramp in the moment. 
Low in salt?
The ‚ÄòDehydration/Electrolyte Depletion Theory‚Äô suggests that if you lose a lot of sodium and don‚Äôt replace it (as is common when you do crazy things like run five marathon loops of backcountry Tennessee or ride the Tour de France solo), it can cause fluid shifts in your body that trigger the cramp.
This idea is supported by plenty of case studies, observational data, anecdote and expert opinion. Scientists call that Level 4 and 5 evidence, because scientists like ranking things. So, although there‚Äôs a decent amount of circumstantial weight behind it, it lacks the more ‚Äúconcrete proof‚Äù of data from large scale randomised controlled trials, or RCTs. (Though Jeff Bezos once said "the thing I have noticed is when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. There's something wrong with the way you are measuring it..." ü§∑).
Not that there isn‚Äôt some lab-based evidence in the mix here as well. A 2019 studyfound that the severity of cramps experienced by athletes were reduced when they drank an electrolyte drink versus a placebo and a more recent paper found that athletes who took in sodium were less likely to develop muscle cramps after their workout.
Occupational hazard
It‚Äôs not just since the invention of lycra that folks have been linking cramp and hydration. Before it was the scourge of Weekend Warriors, muscle spasms were of concern to the captains of industry trying to get the most out of their blue collar workforce.
There were numerous documented cases of miners, construction workers, stokers and foundry workers all suffering with cramp in their hot and sweaty working conditions. If you think finishing an IRONMAN is tough, try 12 hours at the coalface. (Disclaimer: I‚Äôve never done a shift down a mine shaft, but I did watch Billy Elliott).
Their plight was usually associated with high sweat losses and, often, the consumption of large quantities of plain water alongside that. Whilst it‚Äôs fair to say that this early research was not as rigorously structured as modern clinical trials, they did elicit a pretty universal consensus: that providing workers with enough salt and water to help them replace what they were sweating out was quite effective in preventing or treating many cases of cramp.
A classic study on salt depletion found that participants who were deprived of salt and suffered severe cramps experienced a dramatic recovery within as little as 15 minutes of reintroducing salt into their systems. (Note: they ate bacon and drank the warm fat from the pan because, well, it was the 1930s and science was more fun back then). 
In more recent times, the phenomenon has been identified in military personnel and is sometimes associated with hyponatremia, a nasty condition where your blood sodium levels are diluted by overconsuming water and/or excessive losses of sodium.
One UK serviceman who cramped up and collapsed whilst running in the heat during the Gulf War was successfully treated with intravenous saline and was later found to have Cystic Fibrosis, a genetic disorder that causes you to lose very large amounts of salt in your sweat.
This is all very similar to the way I felt in long and hot endurance events. Through trial and error I gradually learned that consuming plenty of sodium before and during races was extremely effective at dramatically reducing my cramping symptoms, as well as helping me perform better in the latter stages. I was even compos mentis enough to propose to my wife at the finish line of one race...
Andy proposing to Lucy
And marrying Lucy was obviously the best decision I‚Äôve ever made. (Yes, this is a test to see if she reads my work).
I later learned through a Sweat Test that I too lose a ton of sodium in my sweat and that this is likely to have contributed to my issues. (Silver lining: this led to me founding PF&H).
Not binary, no silver bullets
In the last few years, a more balanced viewpoint has started to gain ground that positions cramp as multifactorial:
A new model for understanding cramp
Rather than looking for a single silver bullet to ‚Äòcure‚Äô cramp, the authors of review papers in 2019 and 2021 concluded that it‚Äôs highly likely that you‚Äôll need to employ multiple interventions to eliminate ‚Äòdifferent flavours‚Äô of cramp at different times.
They're preaching to the choir with this new model. Although I tended to cramp a lotwhen I was competing and it happened most frequently at longer and hotter races, it didn‚Äôt happen every single race and rarely in training. Nor did increasing my sodium intake make me completely immune from cramping, so clearly there‚Äôs more in play here. 
Cramping isn‚Äôt a zero-sum, black versus white argument between two competing ideas, even if that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs often still presented in both the scientific and mass media because that gets the clicks and Likes that placate our overlords at Google, Meta et al.
With that in mind, here are a few things I‚Äôd suggest you try as part of a mult-faceted approach to getting on top of your issues with cramp‚Ä¶
Mo' Sodium, Potentially Less Problems
Based on my own experiences and an abundance of evidence, it‚Äôs worth looking at your sodium intake in relation to your sweat output. It‚Äôs a relatively cheap and simple exercise that has little downside.
It‚Äôs certainly a good idea if your cramps tend to occur during or after periods of heavy sweating, in hot weather, or if you generally eat a diet low in salt or carbs.
When I first upped my sodium intake before and during long, hot races the effect was immediate and dramatic. I went from cramping up almost every time, to rarely having problems at all. If only there was a free Fuel & Hydration Planner, or even a squad of friendly, helpful humans ready to hop on a free video call to help you home in on what you need.
These days there are higher strength electrolyte drinks and capsules that make it easy to hit higher numbers. I know this because we sell them. üëÄ
Tiredness Kills (Performance)
Because it seems likely that fatigue is also implicated in many instances of cramp, finding ways to minimise this is also logical. 
Don‚Äôt ask your muscles to bring a knife to a gunfight. You‚Äôre not Rambo (unless you‚Äôre reading this, Sly, in which case we should catch up, it‚Äôs been too long).
Train specifically - with the right mix of volume and intensity - for events that tend to trigger cramps to prepare your muscles for what‚Äôs going to be asked of them. Unless you‚Äôre Norwegian, you‚Äôll need to taper into your event so that you‚Äôre fresh when you start. 
When the big day comes around, warm up properly. Particularly if you‚Äôre as old as me (i.e. on the wrong side of the big 4-0) because cold muscles could be common culprits. And carbs are your friend when you‚Äôre ensuring you‚Äôre adequately fueled before you start. 
Then, unless you just want to wave to your mum on TV for 10 seconds, pace yourself appropriately to avoid prematurely overloading muscles and have a decent fueling plan in place to avoid becoming glycogen depleted, as that‚Äôll contribute to premature fatigue.
Alternative medicine
Other strategies that are far from proven, but that either make intuitive sense or have been successfully used in the War on Cramp include sports massage and stretching, acupuncture and mental relaxation techniques.
Although none of these are likely to offer a complete solution they are generally accessible, inexpensive and may even benefit performance in other ways, so there would seem to be little downside to giving them a try.
Putting the necessary work into getting a handle on your cramping is about as fun as Dry January. But, like my wife keeps telling me, it‚Äôll pay dividends down the line. By which I assume she means that I‚Äôll get even more enjoyment out of drinking the entire case of wine that Sean kindly sent me as a carrot. 
Train smart,
Andy
