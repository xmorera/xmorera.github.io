# Implementing Search Article on MSDN

A couple of years ago I wrote an article for MSDN magazine called Implementing Your Own Enterprise Search.

I was really excited as I started my career as a .NET developer and MSDN magazine was the last word and cutting-edge on .NET at the time.

I remember waiting for each new dead-trees edition magazine to arrive so I could read it cover to cover and learn as much as I can.

Well, mostly thanks to Julie Lerman, I was able to write one article as she pointed me in the right direction to submit an idea.

One thing thatâ€™s missing is the source code as MSDN Magazine is no longer maintained so I created a repo for it:
