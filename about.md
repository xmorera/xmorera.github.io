# Who I Am

I'm a technology leader and educator with more than 20 years of experience helping organizations adopt, scale, and operationalize modern tech. I've focused my career on simplifying complex subjects -- from big data to AI -- and turning them into practical training that drives measurable results. I've authored 60+ technical courses on Pluralsight covering AI, software development, generative AI, Python, .NET, and related topics, taught to hundreds of thousands of learners worldwide.

My approach is rooted in breaking down barriers to learning: technical complexity, production bottlenecks, language, and cost. I've been recognized as a Microsoft MVP, hold certifications from the Scrum Alliance, Cloudera, and Microsoft, and have led enterprise training initiatives with large global companies.

Beyond authoring courses, I write and speak about AI, training design, and knowledge transfer on my blog and other platforms. My mission is to democratize knowledge transfer -- making it simple, scalable, and impactful no matter the learner or organization.
