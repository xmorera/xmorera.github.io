# Lupo.ai (Startup I Founded)

Lupo.ai is an enterprise-grade AI platform that turns your organization's existing knowledge into measurable learning outcomes - faster, cheaper, and more consistently than traditional training. Training no longer has to be slow, expensive, and fragmented; with Lupo, it becomes a strategic advantage that accelerates business performance.
