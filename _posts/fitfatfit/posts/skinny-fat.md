**Skinny fat** is a body type where someone appears thin or average in clothes but has a higher body fat percentage relative to their muscle mass, often leading to a soft or undefined physique. At 46 years old, with 17% body fat, you're slightly above the ideal range for a lean look, but not excessively so. The goal for fixing a skinny fat physique is to build muscle and reduce fat simultaneously, known as **body recomposition**. Here’s how to approach it based on your current situation:

### Step-by-Step Approach to Fix Skinny Fat at 46 Years Old with 17% Body Fat:

1. **Assess Your Goal**: 
   - If your main goal is to build muscle and gain size while staying relatively lean, a **body recomposition** approach would work best given your body fat percentage.
   - You are not at a high enough body fat to warrant a strict cut, and bulking would likely add more fat than you’d want.

2. **Why Body Recomposition?**:
   - You’re in a great position to pursue body recomposition, as you’re not overly fat but need more muscle. This approach allows you to build muscle and lose fat at the same time, which is ideal for someone in your body fat range (around 15-20%).

3. **Nutrition: Slight Calorie Deficit**:
   - Aim for a **slight calorie deficit** (100-500 calories below maintenance). This will promote fat loss without hampering muscle growth. 
   - Your goal should be to **lose fat slowly** while maintaining enough energy to build muscle.
   - Calculate your maintenance calories by multiplying your weight (in pounds) by 14-16, and then reduce that number by 100-500 calories.

4. **High Protein Intake**:
   - Consume **1 gram of protein per pound of body weight** (around 155-170 grams of protein for you). Protein is essential for muscle growth and preserving lean mass while in a slight calorie deficit.
   - Spread your protein intake evenly across **3-5 meals** to keep muscle protein synthesis elevated throughout the day.

5. **Strength Training: Focus on Progressive Overload**:
   - Follow a structured **strength training program** that focuses on **compound lifts** like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and rows. Train each muscle group at least **2 times per week** with 10-20 sets per muscle group per week.
   - **Progressive overload** is key—gradually increase the weight or reps to force your muscles to grow. You’ll want to push each set close to failure to maximize muscle growth.
   - **Change up routines** if needed to introduce a new stimulus, as this can help prevent plateaus and promote growth.

6. **Nutrient Timing: Pre- and Post-Workout Nutrition**:
   - **Pre-Workout**: Consume carbs and protein before your workout (e.g., 1-2 hours prior) to fuel your performance.
   - **Post-Workout**: Have a meal rich in protein and carbs after your workout to aid recovery and boost muscle protein synthesis.

7. **Low to Moderate Cardio**:
   - Add **low-to-moderate intensity cardio** (e.g., walking or cycling) 2-3 times a week to increase calorie expenditure without risking muscle loss. 
   - Avoid excessive high-intensity cardio, which may interfere with muscle recovery.

8. **Recovery: Sleep and Rest**:
   - Get **7-9 hours of quality sleep** per night. Sleep is crucial for muscle recovery and fat loss.
   - Ensure adequate rest between workouts to avoid overtraining, which can hinder both muscle growth and fat loss.

### Why Not Bulk or Cut?
- **Bulking** at 17% body fat would likely lead to more fat accumulation before you gain enough muscle, pushing your body fat to levels where you'd need a cut later.
- **Cutting** aggressively would make you leaner, but without enough muscle underneath, you might still look “skinny fat” after losing the fat. You would also sacrifice strength gains.

### Conclusion:
For your situation, body recomposition is the optimal choice to address the skinny fat physique. You can **build muscle and lose fat** at the same time by following a slight calorie deficit, high protein intake, progressive strength training, and proper recovery. Over time, this will help you build a leaner, more muscular physique without needing extreme bulking or cutting phases. Stay consistent and patient, as body recomposition progress can be slower but yields sustainable results.
