# Lupo.ai Listed in Microsoft AppSource 

How old is a company? 

Do you measure its "age" since the day that it got incorporated?

Or from the day when you got started learning the craft or incubating the idea?

In my case, I started in the learning and development space in 2002, when I was involved in the creation and delivery of training materials on adopting .NET. 

At the time I used to work for a company called ArtInSoft, which was short for Artificial Intelligence Software—yeap, they were a little bit ahead of their time.

They had this awesome programming language that was used to specify the rules for migrating from one programming language to another. At the time, we were working on teaching Microsoft partners how to migrate from VB6 to VB.NET. 

ArtInSoft created the migration assistant that was embedded in Visual Studio 1.0, and I was part of programming history by moving one codebase at a time and teaching developers one room at a time.

Fast-forward many years and I've been involved in many more learning and development roles. One of my main roles is being an author for Pluralsight, where hundreds of thousands of learners have taken my courses. 

As a side note, check out my profile if you want to learn about programming and bleeding edge topics like Generative AI: C:\github\xmorera\xmorera.github.io\2024\images

But today I am writing this post because it is the start of what I hope is a new era.

Today is day 1 for our company being listed at @Microsoft AppSource. It may not be a big deal in general, as we are doing the same thing we were doing yesterday. It is not like we have opened the flood gates for new customers.

But for us it represents a milestone, because we had to become an official Microsoft Partner company to be listed in AppSource. 

There are many more steps to come, this is just the first. As the old saying goes "a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step".
