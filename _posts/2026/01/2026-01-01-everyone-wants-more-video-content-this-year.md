# Everyone Wants More Video Content This Year

![ALT](/images/2026/01/everyone-wants-more-video-content-this-year.jpg)

Everyone wants more video content this year.
Almost no one has more time.
That tension is exactly where AI can make a real difference.
Video has become a key part of how companies market, educate customers, support sales, and even communicate internally. But traditional video production is slow and expensive: briefs, scripts, storyboards, recordings, edits, reviews… and by the time you are done, the opportunity may have already passed.
This is where lupo.ai comes in.
Instead of treating video as a one-off project, you can turn it into a fast, repeatable process:
- Start from a simple idea, outline, or existing content
- Turn it into scripts and storylines optimized for your audience
- Generate and refine videos for marketing campaigns, product explainers, customer education, and more
- Iterate quickly and produce multiple versions for different channels or segments
Hours (or days) of work turn into minutes.
The goal is not just to “use AI.”
The goal is to free time so teams can focus on strategy, creativity, and talking to customers – while lupo.ai helps handle the heavy lifting of video creation.
