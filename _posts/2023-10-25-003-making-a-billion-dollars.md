# Making a Billion Dollars

Here’s an article that I found and I think it is interesting and relevant to us. Most people want to be rich, but just wanting to be rich is not usually the way to get ahead in life and typically people that just pursue money most likely fail and get frustrated while doing it.

The best way to get ahead in life is to create something of value… something that people need and that will solve work problems that they run into.

That’s where we are with [Lupo.ai](https://lupo.ai), our Content Production System. We have built a platform that solves a real problem in the enterprise. We are still struggling to find the correct message and at the moment do not have a way to onboard customers quickly, if needed.

But we are getting there. We are on our way to find product-market fit successfully. Once we do, we will change how companies create and manage their content.

Here’s the catch:

We need to focus. 

We need to learn. 

We need to pay attention to how our customers use our product and the problems that they face and how they solve them.

We need to remember that this is not a university project. Adding features is not the solution. We need to identify how to solve our customers' problems and give them value, and we will receive back.

We have to be disciplined, we need to communicate properly. 

Motivation is not the key, discipline is what gets us ahead. 

Here’s an article that you may find interesting, that talks about this. My favorite phrase being “**Shift your focus away from what you want (a billion dollars) and get deeply, intensely curious about what the world wants and needs.**“

Thoughts, comments, or questions?

> Justine Musk, first wife of billionaire Elon Musk, knows a thing or two about wealth and hard work — her ex-husband is a founder of PayPal, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and has an estimated net worth of $248.7 billion.
> 
> She posted a response to a Quora thread asking the question “Will I become a billionaire if I am determined to be one and put in all the necessary work required?”
> 
> Her answer is “no,” though she says that the Quora reader is asking the wrong question altogether.

> “You’re determined. So what? You haven’t been racing naked through shark-infested waters yet,” she writes. “Will you be just as determined when you wash up on some deserted island, disoriented and bloody and ragged and beaten and staring into the horizon with no sign of rescue?”

> She then offers some advice:

> “Shift your focus away from what you want (a billion dollars) and get deeply, intensely curious about what the world wants and needs. Ask yourself what you have the potential to offer that is so unique and compelling and helpful that no computer could replace you, no one could outsource you, no one could steal your product and make it better and then club you into oblivion (not literally). Then develop that potential. Choose one thing and become a master of it. Choose a second thing and become a master of that. When you become a master of two worlds (say, engineering and business), you can bring them together in a way that will a) introduce hot ideas to each other, so they can have idea sex and make idea babies that no one has seen before and b) create a competitive advantage because you can move between worlds, speak both languages, connect the tribes, mash the elements to spark fresh creative insight until you wake up with the epiphany that changes your life.

> The world doesn’t throw a billion dollars at a person because the person wants it or works so hard they feel they deserve it. (The world does not care what you want or deserve.) The world gives you money in exchange for something it perceives to be of equal or greater value: something that transforms an aspect of the culture, reworks a familiar story or introduces a new one, alters the way people think about the category and make use of it in daily life. There is no roadmap, no blueprint for this; a lot of people will give you a lot of advice, and most of it will be bad, and a lot of it will be good and sound but you’ll have to figure out how it doesn’t apply to you because you’re coming from an unexpected angle. And you’ll be doing it alone, until you develop the charisma and credibility to attract the talent you need to come with you.

> Have courage. (You will need it.)

> And good luck. (You’ll need that too.)”
