# **Masterclass: Understanding and Improving Decoupling (Pw\:HR) in Cycling**

## üîç What is Aerobic Decoupling?

**Decoupling** (also known as Pw\:HR or aerobic decoupling) measures the *cardiovascular drift* during prolonged efforts. It quantifies how well your heart rate aligns with your power output over time. In practical terms, during a steady sub-threshold effort (like a long climb or zone 2 ride), power and heart rate should remain proportional. Decoupling occurs when **your heart rate rises while your power stays constant**, or vice versa.

The **Pw\:HR** metric is calculated by comparing the *efficiency factor* (EF = normalized power / avg heart rate) in the first half vs. the second half of the ride:

> **Pw\:HR (%)** ‚âà (EF‚ÇÇ - EF‚ÇÅ) / EF‚ÇÅ √ó 100

This percentage reflects how well your body maintains efficiency over time. In platforms like **TrainingPeaks** and **WKO5**, this is automatically calculated when you highlight a steady segment of a ride longer than 20 minutes. A higher value means you fatigued or struggled to sustain effort efficiently.

## üß† Why Does It Matter?

Physiologically, when you fatigue, **stroke volume drops**, and your body compensates by increasing heart rate to maintain cardiac output. So even if your watts stay constant, your cardiovascular system has to work harder. This ‚Äúdrift‚Äù reveals your **aerobic durability**‚Äîyour ability to maintain a steady effort without significant metabolic cost increases.

A cyclist with **low decoupling** (under 5%) shows strong aerobic conditioning, while **high decoupling** (10% or more) suggests a need for improved endurance or better pacing. Environmental factors (heat, hydration, fueling) can also affect this drift.

## ‚úÖ How to Interpret Pw\:HR

| **Pw\:HR Value** | **Interpretation**                                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **< 5%**         | Excellent durability. Strong aerobic base.                                   |
| **5‚Äì10%**        | Acceptable, but some fatigue showing.                                        |
| **>10%**         | Poor durability or incorrect pacing. Suggests aerobic drift or overexertion. |

Elite cyclists often show decoupling below 2% even in long events. The goal of base training and durability workouts is to keep this number as low as possible across long durations.

## üîç When Is Decoupling Relevant?

Use decoupling analysis in:

* Zone 2/low Zone 3 endurance rides
* Long steady-state climbs
* Sweet spot/tempo sessions >30 min
* Indoor workouts at constant effort (using Wahoo Kickr or similar)

Avoid using it for:

* High-intensity intervals
* Rides with frequent surges or sprints
* Mixed terrain with constantly varying effort

Essentially, you need **steady effort** with minimal interruptions to generate meaningful decoupling data.

## üß≠ How to Find and Analyze Decoupling in TrainingPeaks

### Step-by-Step:

1. Open a ride >60 minutes with power and heart rate data.
2. Highlight a continuous steady section (20‚Äì60 min), ideally Z2-Z3.
3. Look at the right panel in TrainingPeaks: **Pw\:HR** will be shown.
4. If not shown, click ‚ÄúChart Options‚Äù and enable Efficiency Factor and Pw\:HR.

You can then log this value or tag the workout for tracking over time.

To analyze historically:

* Filter by long rides (>2.5h or >80km)
* Create a spreadsheet to log EF and Pw\:HR by date
* Compare similar workouts over time to see if decoupling is improving

## üìä Using Strava, TrainingPeaks, and WKO5

* **TrainingPeaks**: Best for individual session analysis. Automatically calculates Pw\:HR and EF. Use the ‚ÄúWorkout Details‚Äù view.
* **Strava**: Doesn‚Äôt show Pw\:HR, but great for identifying long, steady rides and syncing data to TP or WKO.
* **WKO5**: Advanced tool for long-term tracking. Create custom charts showing trends in Pw\:HR and EF over time. You can build reports to analyze durability by month, type of workout, or progression.

WKO5 also includes **Fatigue Resistance Models**, **Time to Exhaustion curves**, and **power under fatigue**, which can all complement your understanding of decoupling.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Train to Improve Decoupling

### 1. **Long Z2 Rides (Endurance Base)**

* 3‚Äì5 hours at 55‚Äì75% of FTP
* Focus on consistent fueling and hydration
* Goal: keep heart rate steady throughout

### 2. **Accumulated Tempo / Sweet Spot Work**

* Examples: 3√ó20 min @ 88‚Äì94% FTP with short rest
* Builds muscular endurance and aerobic efficiency
* Add volume progressively

### 3. **Tempo Under Fatigue**

* Do 2 hours Z2 then finish with 20‚Äì40 min tempo
* Teaches your body to sustain effort even when tired
* Analyze decoupling in the final section

### 4. **Long Hill Repeats**

* 2√ó30 min climbs at steady tempo
* Focus on smooth cadence and constant output
* Good simulation for race efforts

### 5. **Low Cadence Strength Endurance**

* 4‚Äì6√ó6 min @ 60 rpm and 85‚Äì90% FTP
* Trains neuromuscular recruitment and pedaling economy

### 6. **Cadence-Based FC Work**

* Hold HR constant and let power vary
* Teaches you to control effort by heart rate on long climbs

### 7. **Combined Workouts**

* Example: 60 min Z2 ‚Üí 3√ó10 min Z3
* Simulates the increasing effort of a race or fondo

## üóÇÔ∏è How to Track Progress

1. **Monthly Testing**: Ride 60 min steady at Z2-Z3, then compare HR first vs. last 30 min.
2. **Log Pw\:HR**: In TrainingPeaks, manually add a comment or field to each endurance workout.
3. **Look for trends**: If Pw\:HR drops over 4‚Äì6 weeks for similar efforts, you‚Äôre improving.
4. **Check EF**: An increasing EF (more watts per bpm) means your cardiovascular efficiency is rising.

Also track metrics like:

* Recovery heart rate
* HR response to warm-up
* Power under fatigue
* RPE vs. HR drift

## üß™ Scientific Context

* Studies on **durability in endurance athletes** show that cardiac drift correlates with **fatigue resistance** and **metabolic fitness** (see Maunder et al., 2021).
* Training-induced improvements in **mitochondrial density**, **capillary perfusion**, and **stroke volume** reduce Pw\:HR over time.
* **FasCat Coaching** and **Joe Friel** emphasize aerobic decoupling as a gold standard marker of base endurance.

## ‚úÖ Summary

* **Aerobic decoupling** measures how much more effort (heart rate) it takes to maintain the same output (power) over time.
* Use it to test your **durability**, **aerobic fitness**, and **pacing strategy**.
* Keep Pw\:HR below 5% for strong aerobic base.
* Improve it with **long rides**, **tempo intervals**, and **low-cadence strength work**.
* Track trends over weeks/months for progress.
