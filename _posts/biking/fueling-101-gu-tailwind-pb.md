## **Fueling Chemistry 101: How to Combine GU, Tailwind & Peanut Butter for Maximum Power**

### 🧠 Why Carb Mixing Matters

Your muscles burn carbohydrate like a furnace during hard rides — but your gut is the bottleneck. It can only absorb so much at once. That’s why **mixing different carbohydrate types** is key to hitting high fueling targets (80–100+ g/hour) without bloating or bonking.

Your body uses:

* **SGLT1 transporter** for glucose-based carbs (e.g. **maltodextrin**, **dextrose**, **GU**, **Tailwind**).
* **GLUT5 transporter** for **fructose**.

By using **both transporters at once**, you can increase total carb absorption by 30–50%. This is why elite athletes use **multi-transportable carbs** (glucose + fructose) in a specific ratio — usually **2:1 or 1:0.8** glucose\:fructose.

### ⚙️ Breaking Down Your Fuel Choices

| Fuel                    | Carb Types              | Carbs per Serving | Notes                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GU Gel**              | Maltodextrin + Fructose | \~21–23g          | Excellent 2:1 blend; fast absorption                                 |
| **Tailwind (2 scoops)** | Dextrose + Sucrose      | \~50g             | Easy on gut; also contains \~300mg sodium                            |
| **PB Sandwich**         | Starch + Sucrose        | \~35–50g          | Slow-digesting; real food with fat/protein; good early in long rides |

### 🔁 Mix-and-Match Strategy (For Long Rides & Races)

#### 💡 Goal: 80–90g carbs/hour

Use a combo like this per hour:

* 1 bottle of **Tailwind** (2 scoops) → 50g
* 1 **GU gel** → 22g
* Half **peanut butter sandwich** (if tolerated) → \~20g
  **Total:** \~90g (glucose + fructose combo + fat/protein buffer)

#### 🧱 Structure Your Ride Like This:

* **Hour 1–2:** Tailwind + GU + PB sandwich (solids are easier early)
* **Hour 3–4:** Tailwind + GU only (skip solids if intensity rises)
* **Final Hour:** Switch to **only GU + drink**, maybe add caffeine

---

### ⚖️ Why This Works

* **Tailwind** provides glucose (dextrose) and fructose from sucrose → uses both transporters efficiently
* **GU** adds maltodextrin + fructose → absorbs quickly, complements Tailwind
* **PB sandwich** offers steady, slower-digesting carbs with protein/fat → great for early ride satiety
* **Fat & protein** slow gastric emptying slightly, which helps some people maintain energy longer in the first half
