# Fueling and Hydration Blueprint for a 47-Year-Old Endurance Cyclist in Costa Rica

## Introduction

Endurance cycling in Costa Rica’s mountainous, warm, and humid conditions places heavy demands on nutrition and hydration. A 4–6 hour ride of 100–160 km with 2,000–3,000 m elevation can expend thousands of kilojoules of energy and cause significant sweat losses. Optimizing **fuel intake (carbohydrates)** and **hydration/electrolytes** is critical to sustain high-intensity efforts, delay fatigue, and prevent cramps. This blueprint provides science-based strategies tailored for an advanced amateur cyclist (47 years, 70 kg) who tolerates high carbohydrate intake and typically rides with one mid-ride stop. It includes guidelines for different ride durations, a detailed plan for a 5–6 hour mountainous group ride, a race-day strategy for the Jacó–Quepos–Jacó 140 km event, hydration and cramp-prevention tactics, and optional caffeine use. The recommendations draw from peer-reviewed sports nutrition research and elite endurance practices, translated into practical terms.

## Fueling Strategies by Ride Duration

Matching fuel intake to the duration and intensity of rides ensures adequate energy availability. Longer and harder rides require progressively more carbohydrate to maintain performance. Table 1 summarizes carbohydrate and fluid targets for various ride lengths, followed by detailed guidance for each scenario:

**Table 1. Recommended Intake by Ride Duration**

| Ride Duration | Carbohydrate Intake                 | Fluid Intake<sup>\*</sup>                    | Sodium (Electrolyte) Intake             | Example Fuel Sources                                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **< 2 hours** | \~30–60 g/hour                      | \~0.4–0.8 L/hour                             | \~300–600 mg Na/hour                    | Sports drink (electrolyte + carb); 1–2 gels; water as needed               |
| **2–4 hours** | \~60–90 g/hour                      | \~0.5–0.8 L/hour (adjust to sweat)           | \~400–800 mg Na/hour                    | Sports drink + gels; energy bar or banana for solid food                   |
| **4–6 hours** | \~80–90 g/hour (aim high end)       | \~0.6–1.0 L/hour (in heat)                   | \~500–1000 mg Na/hour                   | Carb drink + gels; add solid snacks (sandwich, rice cake)                  |
| **> 6 hours** | \~90 g/hour (up to 100+ if trained) | \~0.5–1.0 L/hour (per thirst and conditions) | \~600–1200 mg Na/hour (monitor closely) | Carb drink + gels; real food (sandwich, bar) at intervals; broths for salt |

<sup>\*</sup>*Fluid needs vary with climate and sweat rate; values assume warm/humid conditions.*

### < 2 Hours (Short Rides)

For rides under 2 hours, the primary goal is to **start with full glycogen stores and stay hydrated.** If the ride is truly short (<60–90 minutes) and low-to-moderate intensity, you may not need any mid-ride fueling besides water or an electrolyte drink. However, for high-intensity rides approaching 2 hours, carbohydrate intake can boost performance. Aim for \~30–60 g of carbs per hour from easily digestible sources. This could be as simple as a bottle of sports drink or a gel with water. For example, one 500 ml bottle of sports drink (\~20–30 g carb) plus a gel (\~20–25 g) over 1–2 hours would supply \~50 g/hour. Stay hydrated according to thirst, targeting roughly 0.4–0.8 L of fluid per hour in warm conditions. Include electrolytes especially if you sweat heavily – a typical sports drink or electrolyte tablet provides \~300–600 mg sodium per hour in this scenario, which helps replace salt losses. For short rides, **pre-ride nutrition** is key: ensure your breakfast or prior meal is high in carbohydrates (e.g. oatmeal, bread, fruit) so you start with topped-up energy stores.

### 2–4 Hours (Medium Rides)

Rides of 2–4 hours require **steady fueling from the start** to maintain energy. Target approximately 60–90 g of carbohydrate per hour once the ride exceeds \~2 hours. Many athletes perform best toward the higher end (\~90 g/h) on rides approaching 4 hours, especially if intensity is high or there are repeated climbs. Achieving 60–90 g/h can be done by combining products: for example, each hour consume one bottle of sports drink (\~30–40 g), one energy gel (\~20–25 g), and possibly a half energy bar or banana (\~15–20 g). This mix would provide \~60–85 g in an hour. Using **multiple carbohydrate sources** (glucose, maltodextrin, fructose) enables higher absorption rates and helps avoid GI issues. Fortunately, products like GU gels plus a sports drink (or a mix like Tailwind which contains glucose + fructose) already provide this blend.

Hydration should be proactive: about 500–800 ml of fluid per hour is a general guideline, adjusting upward if it’s very humid and you’re a heavy sweater. In 4 hours, plan for \~2–3 L total fluid intake. Include sodium in your drinks or take salt capsules to ingest roughly 400–800 mg sodium per hour over 2–4 hour rides. This level of electrolyte intake helps maintain hydration status and can delay or prevent cramps in susceptible individuals. If you’re using a product like Nuun (≈300 mg Na per tab) or SaltStick capsules (\~215 mg Na each), you might take one *per hour* in addition to what’s in your drink. **Example (3-hour ride)**: Eat a high-carb breakfast (e.g. pancakes with syrup) 1.5–2 hours pre-ride, start the ride with two 750 ml bottles (one with \~60 g carb sports drink, one water or light electrolytes), sip regularly. Consume a gel every 45 minutes after the first hour. This yields \~180 g carbs total (60 g/h) and \~1.8 L fluid (\~0.6 L/h). Adjust upward toward 90 g/h and 0.8 L/h if you find energy dipping or in very hot weather.

### 4–6 Hours (Long Rides)

Long rides in the 4–6 hour range demand **near-maximal carb intake and careful hydration planning**. Glycogen stores alone cannot fuel a 5–6 hour high-intensity ride, so exogenous carbohydrate is essential to avoid “bonking” (energy crash). Aim for \~80–90 g of carbohydrate per hour as a target. Many well-trained cyclists can tolerate \~90 g/h, especially using a mix of drink, gels, and easily digestible solids. In practical terms, this might mean **consuming something every 10–15 minutes**. For example, each hour you could drink \~750 ml of a maltodextrin/fructose drink (providing \~40–50 g), take a gel (\~25 g), and eat part of a solid snack like half a peanut butter sandwich or an energy bar (\~15–20 g). This combination would supply on the order of 80–90 g in that hour. It’s important to individualize the mix – since you tolerate high carbs well and have a “strong stomach,” you can lean into energy-dense options. Many elite endurance cyclists use solid foods (rice cakes, bars, sandwiches) in the early hours of a long ride or race, then switch to gels and drinks as intensity rises or fatigue makes chewing harder. You might do similarly on a 5–6 hour weekend ride: **eat solids in the first half** (when there’s a mid-ride stop, for instance) and rely on quicker carbs (gels, sugary drinks) in the latter half when high intensity efforts (e.g. final climbs or sprints) occur.

Hydration for 4–6 hours in tropical climate is challenging because you will **lose a lot of sweat**. Continue to drink in the range of \~0.6 to 1.0 L/hour. If you know you sweat \~750 ml/hour (as currently consumed), try to match that to prevent excessive dehydration. In 6 hours, that could mean \~4.5 L of fluid. It may not be feasible to carry all of this, so plan **refill stops** (or stash extra bottles) every 2–3 hours. Ensure every liter of fluid has sufficient electrolytes: around 500–1000 mg sodium per liter is recommended for heavy sweating. Consuming \~500–1000 mg sodium per hour in this duration helps maintain electrolyte balance. This can come from sports drink mixes (many have \~600 mg/L) plus supplemental salt capsules or salty foods. **Don’t rely on plain water alone for high volumes**, as that can dilute your sodium and contribute to cramping. Alternate water with electrolyte drinks or always add electrolyte tablets to your bottles. On long rides, also be mindful of **palate fatigue** – after hours of sweets, you might crave something salty or savory. Plan a variety: e.g. carry a peanut butter & jelly sandwich or a tortilla with salty filling to eat at hour 3–4, which can be more satisfying than yet another sweet gel. These also contribute sodium (peanut butter, bread, etc., contain salt). Variety can help you keep eating when the thought of another sweet gel is unappealing, ensuring you don’t fall behind on calories.

### > 6 Hours (Ultra-Endurance)

Rides or events over 6 hours (century+ rides, ultra races) amplify the 4–6 hour recommendations. **Maximize carb intake** around 90 g/hour – some elite ultramarathon cyclists experiment with 100–120 g/hour using special formulations, but for most athletes 90 g/h is a proven, achievable target that greatly prolongs endurance. At these extreme durations, **include substantial real foods** at planned intervals. Your gastrointestinal system might welcome some protein or fat after many hours, and real food can prevent hunger that pure carbs might not satisfy. Good options used by endurance racers include small rice balls or rice cakes, sandwiches, energy bars, bananas, trail mix, even boiled potatoes with salt. Keep the portions small and easy to chew/swallow on the move. Continue to **consume quick carbs regularly** (sports drink, gels) as the foundation, with real food as supplemental especially if the intensity is moderate. If the intensity is very high even late in the ride, prioritize easily digestible carbs and reduce fiber/fat intake to avoid GI distress.

Hydration in ultra-endurance efforts requires **strategic planning** since carrying >6 L of fluid is impossible. Aim to **start well-hydrated (see Hydration section below)**, and take advantage of any aid stations or stops to **refill bottles or hydration packs**. Drinking to thirst is a good starting point (the body’s thirst mechanism works, as studies show ad libitum drinking usually suffices to optimize performance), but in ultra events be careful not to ignore thirst or ration fluids too much. Losing >3–4% body mass from dehydration can impair performance and recovery. Plan a schedule to **check in on hydration status** – for example, if you have drop bag locations or crew stops, do a quick weight or urine color check. Consistently include electrolytes; over very long durations, you may even consider occasional electrolyte-rich foods (pickle juice shots, bouillon broth, salted potatoes) to keep up with sodium. Significant sodium losses (especially in a salty sweater) over many hours can lead to hyponatremia or cramping if only water is replaced. In summary, >6 hour rides demand **eating and drinking almost continuously in small doses**, mixing water, electrolytes, simple sugars, and real foods to meet the sustained needs. Practice this in training so your gut is accustomed to processing fuel for many hours.

## Hydration and Electrolyte Strategy (Cramp Prevention)

Staying hydrated is about more than just drinking water – it’s about managing fluid **and** electrolytes (primarily sodium) to support performance and avoid dehydration or cramps. In a hot, humid environment, sweat rates can be very high (some athletes lose >1 L/hour). It’s not always practical or necessary to replace 100% of losses during exercise, but guidelines suggest aiming for a fluid intake that prevents body weight losses >\~2%. For most, this means **0.4 to 0.8 liters of fluid per hour** during exercise. Your current intake (750 ml per 45–60 min, roughly 0.75–1.0 L/hour) is on the higher end, which is reasonable given the climate and your thirst – many cyclists in heat will drink \~1 L/hour.

**“Drink to thirst” vs. a fixed plan:** Modern research indicates that letting thirst guide you is a safe and effective strategy for most athletes, preventing both dehydration and over-drinking. You mention you “tend to be thirsty,” which suggests your body is giving you clear cues – do listen to them. However, don’t ignore common-sense planning: start each ride already well-hydrated and carry enough fluids (or know where to get more) so that thirst can be quenched. **Avoid over-drinking plain water**, especially before or during long rides, as this can dilute blood sodium (leading to hyponatremia). In fact, one study of laborers in heat found cramps were *not* due to dehydration per se, but to drinking large volumes of plain water with high sweat salt losses. The cramps were alleviated when salt was added to the water. The takeaway: **include electrolytes** in your hydration plan.

Sodium is the key electrolyte lost in sweat. The average athlete loses \~950 mg of sodium per liter of sweat, but individuals vary widely (200 mg/L in some to >2,300 mg/L in others). If you finish rides with white salt streaks on your kit or helmet straps, that’s a sign you may be a “salty sweater,” meaning your sodium losses are on the higher end. Craving salt or experiencing muscle cramps can also hint at sodium depletion. **To prevent cramping and maintain performance, aim to replace a significant portion of sodium lost.** In practice, that means consuming drinks, foods, or supplements that provide on the order of **500–1000 mg of sodium per liter of fluid**. Many commercial sports drinks have \~400–800 mg/L. For example, Tailwind contains \~600 mg Na per liter when mixed at 2-scoop strength, and Nuun tablets provide \~300 mg per 500 ml (\~600 mg/L if two tabs per liter). You can augment this by taking SaltStick capsules (each \~215 mg Na) during the ride – for instance, 1–2 capsules per hour on long rides where you’re mostly drinking water or low-sodium fluids. Adjust based on your personal sweat profile: if you know you sweat heavily *and* very salty, lean towards the higher end (1,000 mg/hour). If you take in a lot of sodium, also make sure you have adequate water with it – a high concentration of sodium without fluid could cause GI upset or be less effective.

**Reducing bottle dependence without compromising hydration:** One of the best ways to need fewer bottles on the bike is to **start the ride fully hydrated**. In the 12–24 hours before a big ride or race, focus on steady fluid intake and include electrolytes with those fluids (especially the evening before and morning of). A proven strategy is **sodium pre-loading**: drinking a high-sodium beverage (e.g. \~1500 mg of sodium in 500 ml of fluid) about 1–2 hours before exercise. Research shows this can expand blood plasma volume and improve endurance in the heat. It essentially hyper-hydrates you by using sodium to retain extra fluid. For example, the night before a long ride, you could drink 500 ml of water with a dissolved electrolyte mix (\~750 mg sodium) and repeat that in the morning \~60–90 min pre-ride. This has been reported to reduce late-exercise cramping and even improve performance in athletes prone to cramps. Just be careful **not** to overdo plain water pre-ride, as that can flush out sodium; always pair water with some salt or take a sports drink. Also, don’t drink so much that you start the ride bloated – you want to absorb it, not carry it in your stomach. If done correctly, pre-hydration means you’ll start with a reservoir of fluid, so you might get by with carrying two bottles and refilling less often, thereby feeling less limited by bottle count.

During the ride, another tactic to stretch your on-bike fluids is to **take advantage of your mid-ride stop**: chug some extra drink while stopped. For instance, when you refill bottles at a store, consider buying an additional 500 ml sports drink or water and drink it on the spot. This way you top up without having to carry that extra volume the whole time. If you’re worried about pit stops or want to avoid them in races, you could consider using a hydration pack even on road for extreme situations (some road riders will use a lightweight 1.5 L pack on very long unsupported rides). Since you prefer bottles, a compromise is using larger bottles (e.g. 1 L bottles, if your frame can fit them, or a third bottle in a jersey pocket for the first part of a ride). Any solution that lets you bring more fluid initially will reduce how frequently you must stop.

Finally, **cramp prevention** deserves special focus. Exercise-associated muscle cramps are thought to result from both muscular fatigue and electrolyte imbalances. High-intensity efforts late in a long ride (100 km+) can trigger cramps due to neuromuscular fatigue, and dehydration or sodium loss may lower the threshold for cramping. To minimize risk: (1) Ensure you have paced and trained appropriately – a well-conditioned muscle is more resistant to fatigue cramps. (2) Stay on top of hydration and electrolytes as discussed – even mild dehydration can increase cramp susceptibility. Notably, **replacing sodium** has been shown in industrial athletes to virtually eliminate heat cramps, and anecdotal evidence in endurance sports links salty sweaters to cramp issues. (3) Consider targeted *preventative* use of a salt solution or pickle juice **right before** the point you usually cramp. For example, if you often cramp around hour 5, taking a salt capsule or a few gulps of pickle juice at hour 4.5 might stave it off. Pickle juice is a curious but effective remedy: about \~80 ml has been found to stop cramps within \~85 seconds in studies – far too fast to work via hydration, so researchers suspect it triggers a neural reflex that calms the cramping muscle. Some riders carry a small vial of pickle brine or a commercial “hot shot” spicy drink to quickly address cramps if they start. This can be your emergency tool: it won’t prevent cramps due to deep fatigue, but it can shorten their duration or stop an early twinge.

In summary, **hydrate early, hydrate often, and include electrolytes**. Use thirst as a guide but respect the limits of your fluid carriage by pre-hydrating and planning refills. To prevent cramps, combine smart training with a strong hydration/electrolyte plan and have a backup cramp remedy on hand. These evidence-based steps will help ensure you remain optimally hydrated without needing to lug a dozen bottles, and keep cramping at bay even in tough conditions.

## Long Ride Case Study: 5–6 Hour Mountain Group Ride (100–160 km)

Let’s apply the above principles to a typical challenging ride: \~5–6 hours, 100–160 km, \~2,500 m of climbing, high intensity (group ride surges), with **one mid-ride stop**. We will walk through **pre-ride meal, during-ride fueling/hydration (broken into first half, mid-stop, second half), and post-ride recovery**, focusing on practical amounts and timing.

**The Day Before:** For a long ride, especially if it’s an important one, ensure you eat well the day before. Emphasize carbohydrates at meals to top off muscle glycogen. For instance, lunch and dinner can include rice, pasta, potatoes, tortillas, etc., along with lean protein. Aim for a high-carb intake on this day (perhaps \~7–10 g/kg of carbs over the whole day if the ride will be very demanding – for a 70 kg cyclist that’s on the order of 500–700 g carbs throughout the day). This “carb load” need not be extreme, but you don’t want to start the ride with depleted stores. Also drink fluids steadily (e.g. carry a water bottle and sip frequently) and include some salt in your food to ensure normal hydration. The evening prior, you could drink an electrolyte drink (for example, one packet of a sports drink or 2 Nuun tabs in water) to boost overnight hydration.

**Breakfast (\~2–3 hours before start):** You currently eat a traditional breakfast of **gallo pinto** (rice and beans) with eggs, bread, and cheese about 1 hour before riding. This is a hearty meal; rice and beans provide complex carbs and some protein/fiber, eggs and cheese provide protein/fat. **One consideration:** 1 hour might be a short window to fully digest a large mixed meal. Since you have a “strong stomach” and are used to this, it may be fine. However, some riders would either eat such a meal a bit earlier (2–3 hours out) or simplify the meal if eating 1 hour out (e.g. more easily digestible carbs, less fiber/fat). Pay attention to how you feel – if you ever experience heaviness early in the ride, consider **reducing fiber or fat** in the pre-ride meal or getting up a bit earlier to eat. For instance, an alternate could be white rice instead of beans (lower fiber) plus eggs, or toast with honey and a small portion of beans. But if your current breakfast sits well, it actually provides a good carb base (rice, beans, bread) plus protein for satiety. Make sure to hydrate with breakfast: drink \~500 ml of water or sports drink in the last 1–2 hours pre-ride. Also, consider taking \~500–750 mg of sodium with that pre-ride fluid (for example, a half teaspoon of salt in your food, or a Nuun tab in your water) to enhance fluid retention. This pre-ride sodium “top-off” can be especially helpful if you anticipate a lot of sweating.

**Ride Start:** Begin the ride already fueling and hydrating from the first half hour – don’t wait until you feel hungry or thirsty. For a 5–6 hour ride, **carry at least two 750 ml bottles** on your bike and **plenty of carbohydrate sources**. A suggested setup:

* **Bottle 1:** Mix of carb + electrolyte (e.g. Tailwind) – \~750 ml water with 2 scoops Tailwind gives \~50 g carbohydrate and 300+ mg sodium. This is your energy drink to sip regularly.

* **Bottle 2:** Either plain water or a lighter electrolyte drink (e.g. water with a Nuun tablet for \~18 oz/500 ml, then topped with water = \~300 mg Na in 750 ml). This gives you something less sugary to alternate with, preventing flavor fatigue and providing extra fluids. *Alternatively*, if you can carry a third bottle in a jersey pocket, you might do two carb bottles and one plain water. But assuming two bottles, we’ll use one for carbs, one for hydration/electrolytes.

* **On-bike fuel:** Bring around **60–90 g of carbs per planned hour** of riding. For 5 hours, that’s \~300–450 g total; for 6 hours, \~360–540 g. Practically, this could be: 6–8 gels (typically \~20–25 g each), one or two bars or solid snacks (30–45 g each), and possibly extra drink mix powder to make more carb drink at the stop. Since you mentioned peanut butter sandwiches, you can pack one sandwich (cut in half) in a jersey pocket. Two slices of bread with peanut butter and maybe jam can provide \~40–50 g of carbs (mostly from the bread and any added honey/jam) plus some fat/protein. Many cyclists enjoy this as a solid food option on long rides.

**During the Ride – First Half (before the stop):** In the first 2–3 hours, aim to consume \~60–90 g carbs and \~500–750 ml fluid each hour. Early on, when intensity might be somewhat lower (warming up, first climbs), you can eat solid foods comfortably. For example, in the **first 2 hours** you might do the following:

* **Hour 1:** Sip from your Tailwind bottle frequently (finish \~half the bottle in the first hour = \~25 g carbs). Eat half a peanut butter sandwich at 30–45 minutes (\~20–25 g carbs) and take a few swigs from Bottle 2 (water/Nuun) to wash it down. That roughly gives 45–50 g carb in hour 1. If you feel good, you could also take a gel at the hour mark to bump it to \~70 g for hour 1. If you’re riding hard early (group surges), you might skip the solid in Hour 1 and use a gel for convenience – adapt based on intensity.

* **Hour 2:** Finish the rest of Bottle 1 (the remaining \~25 g carbs) by around 1.5–2h in. Also consume one or two gels spread over the hour (e.g. at 1:15 and 1:45). That would add \~40–50 g. Continue sipping from Bottle 2 as needed for thirst. By hour 2, you’ve likely consumed roughly 70–90 g in that hour (for example, 25 g from drink + 50 g from two gels = 75 g). **Total by 2h**: \~120–140 g carb consumed, and perhaps \~1.0–1.2 L fluid (assuming one full bottle and part of the second).

At this point (2 hours in), you may be nearing the planned stop if it’s around mid-ride (say at 80–90 km). If not quite yet, continue into **Hour 3** with whatever fuel you have left: perhaps another gel (your bottles might be nearly empty by 2.5h if you’ve been drinking \~750 ml/h). Try not to *completely* run out of fluid before the stop – ration so you have a few sips left if possible. But it’s better to drink and use it than to hold back and get dehydrated. If you’re riding with others, coordinate to stop before everyone’s on fumes.

**Mid-Ride Stop (\~halfway):** This is your opportunity to **refill, refuel, and reset** for the second half. Ideally, plan ahead what you’ll do at the stop so you’re efficient:

* **Fluid Refill:** Refill both bottles. If available, use a sports drink for at least one bottle. For example, buy a Gatorade/Powerade (most corner stores have these) – drink half of it immediately (to rehydrate) and pour the rest into one bottle, topping with water if needed. Fill the other bottle with water (and add your spare Tailwind powder or a Nuun tablet that you brought along). If sports drink isn’t available, water + your own mix is fine. The key is to leave the stop with **2 full bottles (\~1.5 L total)**. Also, **drink extra while off the bike**: you can easily down \~500 ml of fluid at the stop without feeling too full if you take a few minutes. This “tank up” means you carry that fluid in your body rather than on the bike. For instance, finish the remainder of the Gatorade or have a cold can of soda (\~350 ml) at the stop for quick sugars and fluid – many cyclists find a Coca-Cola mid-ride really perks them up (it provides caffeine and \~35 g of sugar). If you do have a Coke, factor that \~35 g into your carb count (it means one less gel needed in the next hour).

* **Electrolytes:** If you’ve been taking salt capsules, take another at the stop. Also choose a salty snack if available – even a small bag of chips or nuts can provide sodium (though go easy on high-fat foods mid-ride; a few chips for salt is fine, but a whole bag may upset your stomach). Since you often cramp after 100 km, this stop is a good time to **proactively address that**: take 1–2 SaltStick caps (which would give \~215–430 mg sodium) and stretch your legs briefly. Ensuring you leave the stop with plenty of sodium in your system can help avoid the late-ride cramps.

* **Food Intake:** Eat something substantial at the stop, especially if you feel at all hungry. You could eat the second half of your peanut butter sandwich here (if not already consumed) or even purchase a quick snack (e.g. a packaged pastry or banana from the shop). Keep it quick to eat and not too heavy – around 30–50 g carbs is a good target. Given you’ve been steadily fueling, you shouldn’t be ravenous, but a real-food break can mentally recharge you. Example: a banana (\~30 g carb, plus potassium) or a small packet of rice crackers. If nothing appeals, at least take another gel as you roll out.

* **Caffeine check:** If you planned to use caffeine (more on this later), the mid-ride stop might be a time to ingest it (say a caffeinated gel or a cup of coffee if the stop is at a café). Since you usually ride without caffeine, you might skip it in training. But if you are feeling a bit low on energy, a **100 mg caffeine gel** at this point (around 3 hours in) could give a noticeable boost for the last 2 hours.

Take 5–10 minutes to do all this – don’t linger too long or your muscles may stiffen (keep lightly moving or stretch). Before rolling out, ensure **both bottles are secured** and you have the remainder of your fuel handy (open a gel so it’s easy to take, etc.).

**During the Ride – Second Half (after stop):** Now you have perhaps 2–3 hours left. The latter part of a long ride is when fatigue sets in and fueling often drops off (either due to rider neglect or mild nausea from so many sweets). This is when **discipline** and variety matter:

* **Hours 4–5:** Continue to target \~60–90 g carbs/hour. By now, you might prefer quick carbs only. Use your replenished bottles: e.g. finish that bottle of sports drink over the next hour (another \~30 g) and take a gel or two (\~20–50 g). If you had a Coke at the stop, its sugar is likely fueling you through this hour. Monitor your body: late in a ride, blood glucose can dip and cause sudden fatigue. If you start feeling weak or light-headed, take in carb immediately (gel or drink) – do not delay thinking “I’ll push through.” It’s easier to prevent a bonk than to come back from one. Also keep **drinking** — even though you hydrated at the stop, the high intensity and climate will dehydrate you steadily. Aim to finish both bottles by the end of the ride. If you find at hour 5 that you still have a full bottle, you’re under-drinking – increase your sips. Conversely, if you somehow run out long before the finish and still have >30 min to go, consider rationing a bit or if possible, make a very quick dash into a store for water to avoid running completely dry (though with one planned stop, ideally you managed volume well).

* **Hour 6 (if applicable):** In the final hour of a 6-hour ride, you may not *feel* like eating, but this is where an extra gel or two can make the difference between finishing strong or crawling in. Because fatigue is high, choose the **simplest carbs** – gels, blocks, or a sports drink. If you have caffeine available and haven’t taken it yet, the start of the last hour is a great time for a caffeine boost (e.g. a caffeinated gel). Caffeine at this point will reduce your perceived exertion and help mobilize any remaining energy, making those last climbs or sprints more tolerable. Also, as you approach the finish, **anticipate cramps** if you’re prone to them: if you feel twinges in a muscle (common in hamstrings or calves after long climbs), try a few seconds of easy pedaling and some quick stretches on the bike. You could also use that pickle juice strategy here: down a mouthful of the brine you saved – even if you’re not cramping yet, it might stave off any imminent ones via neural reflex.

By the end of the ride, if executed well, you would have consumed on the order of 400–500 g of carbohydrate over 5–6 hours, 3–4+ liters of fluid, and several grams of sodium. This aligns with what many elite endurance cyclists do. For instance, professional riders often aim for \~90 g/h of carbs and will consume 4+ bottles in a 5–6 hour race, along with electrolytes. You’re essentially mirroring those practices at an amateur level, adjusted for what your gut can handle (which fortunately, for you, is a lot).

**Post-Ride Recovery:** After such a ride, don’t neglect recovery nutrition. In the first 30 minutes, have a carbohydrate + protein snack to start replenishment. A fruit smoothie with protein, chocolate milk, or rice and beans with some chicken – whatever is convenient and palatable – will help muscle recovery. Aim for \~1.2 g/kg of carbs in the first hour or two post-ride (about 80 g for a 70 kg rider) and \~20–30 g of protein. Also continue to rehydrate: you can weigh yourself before and after the ride to estimate fluid deficit (each kg lost = \~1 L of water). Replace \~150% of that deficit over the next few hours (e.g. if down 2 kg, drink \~3 L extra fluid) with water and electrolytes to fully rehydrate. Given the climate, include salt in your recovery meal or have an electrolyte beverage, as you’ll likely be salt-depleted. Proper refueling and rehydration will also make the next day’s ride (or simply the rest of your day) much more pleasant.

## Road Race Fueling Strategy: Jacó–Quepos–Jacó (140 km)

**Event Description:** The Jacó–Quepos–Jacó route (\~140 km) is a road race/Gran Fondo along Costa Rica’s Pacific coast. The profile appears mostly rolling with moderate hills rather than massive mountain passes (altitude profile shows small climbs under \~100 m). However, the **heat and humidity** at sea level will be a major factor, and the pace in a race or fast fondo will be high. You’ll be riding among others, potentially with limited opportunities to stop. The goal is to **maximize performance – ride as fast as possible – while avoiding hitting the wall or cramping.** This requires a well-devised plan for *before* and *during* the race:

### Pre-Race Preparation (48 hours prior)

**Carbohydrate Loading:** For an event of this length and intensity, a classic carbohydrate load is recommended. Starting \~2 days before, increase your carbohydrate intake significantly – aim for \~10–12 g/kg body mass per day for the 36–48 hours pre-race if possible. For a 70 kg rider, this means \~700 g or more of carbs per day. This is a lot of carbs – practically, focus on easily eaten, high-carb foods: pasta, rice, bread, pancakes, fruits, juices, sports drinks, low-fat cookies, etc. Spread it over many meals/snacks to avoid GI discomfort. The payoff is super-saturated glycogen stores, which can delay fatigue in events >90 min. Even if you don’t hit the absolute target, simply *emphasizing* carbs (e.g. a large pasta dinner, ample breakfast) will help. Also ensure you are not doing any exhausting training in those days – a proper taper (rest) combined with carb loading will stock your energy and not leave you tired at the start.

**Hydration Loading:** As discussed, enter the race hyper-hydrated *with electrolytes*. The evening before, drink an electrolyte-rich drink (about 500 ml with \~750 mg sodium, such as a packet of Precision Hydration 1500 or a DIY mix of water with 1/4–1/2 tsp salt and a bit of juice for flavor). The morning of the race, do the same with breakfast. Avoid guzzling plain water in large amounts; you want to absorb and retain the fluid. Also, avoid alcohol the night before, as it can dehydrate you and disrupt sleep.

**Rest and Miscellaneous:** Get a good night’s sleep (pre-race nerves aside). Lay out your kit, bottles, and fuel the night before. **Plan your on-bike nutrition**: know how many gels, etc., you will carry and where they are (fill your pockets in a way you can access items in motion). If the event allows drop bags or has feed zones, plan those too (e.g. maybe there’s an aid station at the turnaround in Quepos where you can pick up extra bottles or get handed a musette bag of food – check the race info).

**Breakfast (Race Morning):** Eat a high-carb, easily digestible breakfast \~3–4 hours before the start if possible (since races often start early, you might be up at 4am for... at 4am for a 7am start). If that’s not feasible, aim for at least 2 hours prior and choose very **easy-to-digest carbs**. The general guideline is to consume **1–4 g of carbohydrate per kg body mass in the 1–4 hours before exercise**. For 70 kg, that means \~70 g if 1 hour out, up to \~280 g if 4 hours out – practically, something like 100–150 g is a realistic target given a 2–3 hour window. Good pre-race breakfast options include: a bowl of oatmeal with banana and honey, white bread or bagels with jam, pancakes with syrup, or rice with a little egg (minimal oil). Keep fiber and fat low (for example, use honey or jam instead of peanut butter, limit beans/cheese) to speed digestion. Ensure you also **hydrate with breakfast** (e.g. 500 ml sports drink or water with electrolyte) so you’re topped up. If you have an early breakfast (3+ hours out), you might have a small carb snack \~30–60 min before the start as well – e.g. an energy gel or half a sports drink – to prevent feeling hungry and keep blood sugar optimal without causing rebound hypoglycemia.

### During the Race

**Fueling:** In race conditions, aim for the upper end of your carb intake range (around 80–90 g/hour) to maximize performance. The higher intensity will cause faster glycogen burn, and taking in ample carbs will delay fatigue. Start fueling **right from the first 20 minutes** of the race – do not “wait until later” because by then you might already be depleting. Plan a schedule such as: a gel every \~30 minutes, plus continuous sipping of a carb-rich sport drink. Since solid foods are harder to manage at race pace, rely mostly on **gels, energy chews, and drinks**. For example, if the race lasts \~4 hours, bring at least 8 gels (each \~20–25 g carb). You could take one gel at 0:30, 1:00, 1:30, 2:00, etc. Additionally, drink from your bottles frequently; if you start with two 750 ml bottles of energy drink (each \~60 g carb if well-mixed), that covers a big portion of your needs for the first couple hours. Many elite racers consume \~1 g of carb per minute in hard events (60–90 g/h) through a combination of drink and gels, and you should aim to mimic that. Set an alarm on your bike computer or use landmarks (e.g. every 15 km or every time you finish one small climb, take a carbohydrate) as reminders, because in the heat of racing it’s easy to forget to eat until you suddenly bonk.

**Hydration:** Use every opportunity to **stay hydrated without stopping**. If the event has feed zones or neutral support, plan to grab bottles on the move. For instance, many organized events have an aid station around halfway (70 km). As you approach, have one of your bottles already empty, so you can quickly swap it for a full one (either from a volunteer or from a pre-arranged friend). Grab a sports drink if available; if only water is handed out, take it but remember to consume extra salt (a capsule or two) since water alone dilutes electrolytes. Try to drink \~0.75 L/hour as a baseline in the coastal heat. If you find yourself in a fast paceline and drinking is hard, take bigger gulps each time you do drink to meet targets. You might coordinate with teammates or other riders to drink on easier sections. **Pre-open your hydration mix**: for example, if you have a sachet of drink powder to mix at a feed zone, open it beforehand and tape it to your frame. But it might be easier to rely on event-provided drinks or carry enough from the start. One strategy to reduce stopping is to carry a third bottle in your jersey pocket at the start, then when one bottle is empty you can swap in the spare and toss the empty at an aid station. This way you start with \~2.2 L on board (three 750 ml bottles). Combined with pre-race hyperhydration, this might allow you to go the full 140 km with just minimal quick refills.

**Electrolytes and Cramp Prevention:** Racing will increase sweat rate, so keep up your sodium intake. Use at least one electrolyte-rich bottle (if you have two bottles, one could be full-strength sports drink, the other can be slightly lighter mix if you prefer). Consider taking a SaltStick capsule at the start and another mid-race (\~hour 2–3). This would give an extra \~400–500 mg sodium on top of your drinks. The goal is to finish the race as close to euhydrated as possible; losing more than \~2–3% body weight could impair your power output in the later stages. If you feel a cramp coming on during the race, you have to react fast: back off the intensity for a minute, stretch if you safely can, and take in electrolytes/fluids. Many racers swear by **pickle juice or HotShot** for cramp emergencies – if you carry a small 1–2 oz vial, you could swig it at the first sign of a twinge. The rapid relief (often within \~1 minute) from pickle juice is believed to come from neural reflexes, not from correcting electrolyte levels in that moment. So it’s a handy hack if a cramp threatens to take you out of the race. Ultimately, the best cramp prevention is proper pacing and training – but in a competitive race you might push beyond your usual limits. By ensuring you’re fueled and hydrated to the max, you at least eliminate energy and electrolyte shortfalls as causes of fatigue-cramps.

**Maximizing Performance:** The combination of a good carb load, aggressive fueling during the race, and effective cooling/hydration strategies will help delay fatigue. If there are sections of the course where you can douse yourself with water (for cooling) or where the pace eases, use them to your advantage to lower core temperature and get nutrients in. In the final hour, switch to your highest glycemic index fuels – gels, coke, etc., and if you’ve saved a caffeinated gel, take it \~30 km from the finish for a final mental and physical boost. Knowing you have followed a meticulous nutrition plan can also give you a **mental edge**: you can be confident you won’t bonk, which frees you to focus on your effort and tactics. Many riders fatigue in the last 30 km of a long race simply because they under-fueled – by avoiding that mistake, you’ll be passing competitors who suddenly hit the wall. To summarize: in Jacó–Quepos–Jacó, try to **consume \~300–400 g of carbohydrate** over the race (e.g. 5–6 gels + 2 bottles of sport drink + 1 coke from an aid station), **drink 3–4 L of fluid with \~3000 mg sodium** spread across it, and use caffeine strategically (if you choose) to stay sharp to the end. This approach mirrors what successful endurance athletes do to sustain power and prevent performance-killing dehydration or cramps.

## Optional Caffeine Use for Endurance Performance

Caffeine is one of the most potent and proven ergogenic aids for endurance. Using it wisely can increase alertness, reduce perceived effort, and improve endurance performance by \~2–4% on average. Since you rarely use caffeine, you are likely to be **sensitive to its effects** – even a relatively small dose could give a significant boost. Here are best-practice guidelines on caffeine timing, amount, and format:

* **Dosage:** Research shows moderate doses of **3–6 mg per kg body weight** (≈210–420 mg for a 70 kg person) improve endurance performance consistently. Higher doses than 6 mg/kg tend to yield more side effects (jitters, GI upset) with no added performance benefit. Because you’re not habituated to caffeine, it’s smart to start at the lower end. In fact, even **100–200 mg total** (1.5–3 mg/kg) can be ergogenic. A recent update noted that doses <3 mg/kg taken before or **late in exercise** still increase endurance performance without the typical caffeine side effects. **Recommendation:** try \~150–200 mg of caffeine for races or key training sessions at first. You can always experiment with up to \~250 mg if you feel you need a stronger effect, but many athletes find \~200 mg is plenty.

* **Timing:** Caffeine reaches peak levels about 45–60 minutes after ingestion for most forms (pill, drink). If taking a single dose, ingest it \~1 hour before the ride or race. However, another strategy—especially for long events—is split dosing. For example, **100 mg 30–60 min before the start, and another 100 mg around mid-ride** (say at 2–3 hours into a 5-hour ride). This can maintain the stimulant effect later into the event as the first dose tapers off. In prolonged exercise, consuming caffeine **during** the activity is also effective. Some athletes skip the pre-dose and only take caffeine in the second half of a race when mental fatigue sets in – this is viable too, particularly if you worry about pre-race nerves. Given your low habitual intake, you might feel more comfortable not being caffeinated at the start (when adrenaline is high anyway) and instead use caffeine as a boost at the **onset of fatigue** (a strategy supported by experts). It’s worth experimenting in training: try a ride where you take \~100 mg at the 2-hour mark and observe the effect.

* **Format:** Caffeine can be ingested in many forms – choose what is practical and sits well with you:

  * **Pills/Capsules:** Very reliable dosing (e.g. 100 mg or 200 mg caffeine pills like NoDoz). They’re easy to carry and have neutral taste. Take with water. Downside: they may hit all at once and can’t be “sipped” like a drink.
  * **Gels/Chews with caffeine:** Many sports gels have caffeine (typically 20–50 mg per gel). These are great for during exercise; you can spread out intake by having one caffeinated gel every hour in addition to regular ones. For instance, you might use a 40 mg caffeine gel each hour from hour 3 onward for a steady low dose. Chewable blocks (Clif Bloks, etc.) also come caffeinated (usually 25 mg per serving).
  * **Coffee:** A typical 8 oz (240 ml) coffee has \~80–150 mg of caffeine depending on brew strength. Many riders love their pre-ride coffee ritual. If your stomach handles coffee and you enjoy it, a strong cup 1–2 hours before the ride can cover your caffeine needs. Just be cautious: coffee can sometimes cause GI stimulation (bathroom visit!) due to compounds beyond caffeine. Also the dose can be variable. Given you rarely have it, a small cup might be enough – no need for a giant Starbucks.
  * **Energy drinks/shots:** Drinks like Red Bull (\~80 mg in 8.4 oz) or Monster (160 mg in 16 oz) provide caffeine and carbs. These can be useful at a mid-ride stop or before the start. Energy “shots” (5-hour Energy \~200 mg in 2 oz) are compact but potent – they work, but some find them too intense. If you go this route, maybe try half a bottle (100 mg) first.
  * **Caffeine gum or mints:** These absorb caffeine through the lining of the mouth, leading to a faster boost (useful late in a race when you need immediate alertness). For example, caffeinated gum like Run Gum (50 mg per piece) can kick in within minutes. This could be an option in the final 30 minutes of a race if you need one last lift.

* **Precautions:** Since you’re not a regular caffeine user, you may feel side effects more strongly. Common ones include: increased heart rate and jitters, anxious feeling, gastro-intestinal cramps, or the urgent need to urinate or defecate. The good news is lower doses minimize these. Also, regular endurance exercise tends to blunt some negative effects like diuresis – studies show caffeine doesn’t significantly dehydrate habitual users during exercise, and even for non-users the diuretic effect is mild during exercise. Still, try caffeine in training first: for example, take 150 mg before a hard 2-hour ride. If you find you get too jittery or it upsets your stomach, you can adjust (e.g. try 100 mg or take it later in the ride rather than on an empty stomach). Everyone’s response is a bit different (there are genetic differences in caffeine metabolism and receptor sensitivity), so personal trial is key.

* **Caffeine Timing and Sleep:** One advantage of rarely using caffeine is that when you do use it, it’s very effective. However, be mindful of when – if you have a late-afternoon or evening ride, taking caffeine could impair your nighttime sleep (caffeine’s half-life is \~5 hours, so it can linger). For morning workouts or races (like most of your rides), this isn’t a problem, and any extra alertness or mild insomnia the night before a big event can often be mitigated by stopping caffeine intake by early afternoon at the latest.

In summary, **caffeine is a powerful optional tool** in your nutrition arsenal. For a key race like Jaco–Quepos–Jaco, a sensible plan might be: have \~100 mg with breakfast or 30 minutes before the start (e.g. a cup of coffee or caffeinated gel), then another \~100 mg at the midpoint (perhaps a caffeinated gel or two). This would total \~200 mg, well within the optimal range and likely yield a noticeable performance boost without causing you to feel unwell. Always tailor the plan to how you feel – if nerves are high, you can delay caffeine until you’re underway and more relaxed. And if you choose to ride without caffeine on a given day, that’s fine too; you’re already doing everything right with carbs, hydration, and electrolytes to ensure strong performance. Caffeine is just the icing on the cake for an extra kick when needed.

**Practical Takeaway:** By implementing these evidence-based fueling and hydration strategies, you’ll be well-equipped to tackle anything from short intense rides to epic 6-hour adventures. In practice, this means **fueling early and often with easily absorbed carbs, hydrating to match your sweat losses with electrolyte-rich fluids**, and using tools like sodium loading, and possibly caffeine, to enhance endurance in the heat. With a strong nutrition plan, you can ride at higher intensities longer, delay the onset of fatigue, and greatly reduce the chance of mid-ride energy crashes or cramps. This blueprint, grounded in peer-reviewed science and elite endurance practices, should serve as a personalized guide to help you perform at your best on Costa Rica’s challenging terrain. Stay consistent with these habits in training, adjust based on your body’s feedback, and come race day you’ll have the confidence that your nutrition is as dialed as your training. Good luck and happy riding!
