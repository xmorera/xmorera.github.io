# Masterclass: Improving Cycling Climbing and FTP on 10 Hours per Week

## Introduction

Meet the athlete: a 47-year-old advanced amateur cyclist (69–70 kg, 165 cm) with about 10 hours per week to train. The goal is to **substantially boost climbing performance and Functional Threshold Power (FTP)** despite limited training time. The athlete has access to a power meter, Wahoo Kickr smart trainer, and heart rate monitor. Training zones (Z1–Z5) are set by Joe Friel’s lactate threshold heart rate (LTHR = 164 bpm), ensuring workouts can be guided by both heart rate and power. In this masterclass, we’ll build a science-backed training framework – including intensity distribution, specific workouts, strength training, periodization, climbing tactics, progress tracking, and recovery strategies – **all tailored for a masters athlete with limited hours**. Each section provides clear action items and is grounded in evidence and best practices for effective cycling training.

## Training Intensity Distribution: Polarized vs. Pyramidal Models

One of the first considerations is how to distribute your limited training time across intensity zones. Two popular models are **polarized** (mostly easy + some very hard, little middle) and **pyramidal** (mostly easy + some moderate + a bit of hard). Both have merits, and evidence exists for each:

&#x20;*Pyramidal training allocates the majority of time to low-intensity (Zone1, green), some to moderate intensity (Zone2, yellow), and the least to high intensity (Zone3, red). It builds a large aerobic base with a smaller proportion of intense work.*

&#x20;*Polarized training minimizes middle-zone work. Most time is at low intensity (Zone1, green) and a significant portion is at high intensity (Zone3, red), with very little in mid-zone (yellow). This model emphasizes easy days *very* easy and hard days extremely hard.*

* **Polarized 80/20 Approach:**

Research shows well-trained endurance athletes achieved the greatest improvements in key performance markers (VO₂max, time to exhaustion, peak power) with a polarized distribution (about 80% low intensity, 20% high intensity). This means **most rides are easy (Zones1–2)**, and **1–2 sessions per week are very intense (Zone5)**. One study found polarized training elicited greater gains than threshold-focused training in recreational athletes. The polarized model can simultaneously build aerobic base and top-end capacity – ideal for boosting both endurance and climbing punch.


* **Pyramidal (Traditional) Approach:** 

![pyramidal](/images/2025/pyramidal-training.png)

Many successful athletes naturally follow a pyramidal intensity distribution. Here, you still spend the bulk of time in **Zone1–2 easy rides**, but include a moderate amount of **Zone3–4 “tempo” or threshold riding**, and a small amount of **Zone5 high intensity**. Evidence supports pyramidal training as well – for example, a study on triathletes found almost no performance difference between a pyramidal vs. polarized program; athletes had similar half-Ironman results. In fact, the researchers noted time in moderate Zone2 (in a 3-zone model) **correlated positively with performance**, suggesting you shouldn’t completely neglect mid-level efforts.



**Which to choose?** With \~10 hours/week, a **hybrid of polarized and pyramidal** may work best. In practice, that means: keep \~70–80% of your weekly time at low intensity (Zone1–2) and \~20–30% at higher intensities. Don’t eliminate moderate efforts entirely (especially sweet spot/threshold work that efficiently raises FTP), but ensure easy rides truly stay easy to allow quality on hard days. For our 47-year-old, focusing on quality over quantity is key. Both models agree on one thing: **make hard days hard and easy days easy**. Given limited time, avoid spending too much time in the “gray zone” (moderate-hard every ride) which can lead to stagnation and fatigue. Instead, plan clear distinctions: some long slow sessions and some really intense interval sessions. This approach maximizes adaptation on a time budget.

## Weekly Training Structure and Key Workouts

With an intensity distribution in mind, let’s map out a typical week. The athlete’s schedule includes 3–4 hours outdoor (hilly terrain) and 3–4 hours indoor (Kickr) riding, plus strength sessions. We will designate **two days for high-intensity bike workouts**, and the rest for endurance or recovery. This yields roughly an 80/20 split by time (e.g. 8 hours low, 2 hours high). Each workout will be described with its purpose and target zones (heart rate and power):

* **Endurance Ride (Zone 2)** – These are longer, steady rides to build your aerobic base and fatigue resistance. *Example:* 2.5–3 hour outdoor ride mostly in **Zone2 (endurance)**, which for LTHR 164 might be roughly 130–140 bpm (power \~55–70% of FTP). Keep the pace comfortable: you should be able to converse in full sentences. Climbs should be ridden easily or with very short bursts if needed. **Purpose:** Improve mitochondrial capacity, capillary density, and teach the body to burn fat for fuel. Over time, these rides raise your endurance and make hard efforts feel easier because your aerobic “engine” grows. *Evidence:* Extensive Zone2 volume is a cornerstone of building fitness – even masters athletes benefit from piling up low-intensity miles as tolerated. Aim to accumulate at least one ride of 2–4 hours each week in Zone2. (If 3 hours continuous is not feasible indoors, consider two shorter Zone2 rides on separate days to total \~3+ hours.)

* **Sweet Spot / Tempo Intervals (Zone 3–4)** – Sweet spot is the upper end of Zone3 (\~88–94% FTP, just below threshold power; HR will be mid- to high Zone3). It’s called the “sweet spot” because it balances intensity and volume – quite hard but sustainable for extended periods, yielding big training stimulus without as much fatigue as true threshold work. *Example:* an **indoor sweet spot interval workout**: 2×20 minutes at \~90% FTP (HR \~150–158 bpm, high Z3 to low Z4), with 5 minutes easy spinning between intervals. Or outdoors, find a 15–20 minute climb and ride up at a steady challenging pace (just below your 1-hour race effort). **Purpose:** Time-efficiently boost your FTP and muscular endurance. With only 10 hours/week, sweet spot allows a lot of time near-threshold power, stimulating aerobic adaptations similar to longer Zone2 rides in less time. *Evidence:* Coaches often use sweet spot training for time-crunched cyclists to accumulate more training load. In fact, base training for many masters cyclists includes “lots of Zone2, tempo and sweet spot” to build a high training load efficiently. Include one sweet spot or tempo session most weeks, especially in base/build phases – but remember it is still a fairly intense effort, so count it toward your weekly 20–30% high-intensity quota.

* **Threshold Intervals (Zone 4)** – These are classic FTP workouts at \~100% of FTP (or slightly above), corresponding to high Zone4 heart rate (near 160 bpm for LTHR 164 by the end of an interval). *Example:* an **outdoor hill repeat**: 3×10 minutes *at FTP* on a climb, with 5-minute descents or easy spins to recover. Or indoors: 3×10 at 95–100% FTP, 5 min easy between. Another variant is “over-unders”: e.g. 3×12 minutes where you alternate 2 min just above FTP (Zone5a HR, e.g. 165–168 bpm) and 2 min just below FTP (Zone4 HR \~155–160 bpm) repeatedly – this trains you to handle surges and clear lactate. **Purpose:** Directly raise your lactate threshold power – the maximal steady effort you can sustain \~1 hour. Threshold workouts increase aerobic enzyme activity and improve the lactate clearance and tolerance needed for long climbs and time trials. *Evidence:* Spending time at or just above lactate threshold is a proven way to push it higher. One study found that including a threshold training block improved cyclists’ power at lactate threshold significantly. However, threshold work is taxing, so do it once per week at most (often alternating with VO₂max workouts on different weeks or separated by days).

* **VO₂max Intervals (Zone 5)** – High-intensity interval training (HIIT) aimed at raising your aerobic capacity and power on climbs. These intervals are performed at \~105–120% of FTP (well into Zone5 power, often eliciting near-max heart rate by the end of each effort). Heart rate will lag but typically ends in Zone5 (for example, HR might reach 164–170+ bpm, \~100%+ of LTHR). *Example:* **VO₂max indoor session**: 5×3 minutes at 115% FTP with 3-minute recoveries, or 4×4 minutes at 110% FTP with 4-min recoveries. For variety, you can also do “30/30s” (30 seconds very hard \~120% FTP, 30 seconds easy spin, repeated 10–20 times in a set) – these short floater intervals accumulate time at VO₂max with slightly less strain on the mind. **Purpose:** Increase **aerobic capacity (VO₂max)** and power output for hard efforts. Improving VO₂max will raise your ceiling, which in turn allows a higher FTP and more power on climbs. *Evidence:* A study comparing interval designs found workouts like 6×5 minutes \~108–115% of FTP (with rests) significantly boosted cyclists’ VO₂max and max aerobic power. High-intensity intervals are especially crucial for masters athletes: after 40, **VO₂max declines faster than other metrics**, so keeping up intense training can slow this decline. Include a VO₂ session nearly every week during build phases (except recovery weeks), but be cautious with frequency (more on recovery later).

* **Anaerobic Hill Sprints (Zone 5+)** – Although not explicitly asked, a touch of anaerobic capacity work can help your ability to attack short steep ramps or sprint at a climb finish. *Example:* find a short steep hill (30–60 seconds long) and do 5× all-out sprints up it (HR will spike but focus on max power, not HR). Recover fully (4–5 min) between. These are very taxing; include occasionally (e.g. every other week or during a specialty phase) if you need that explosive power for your riding or races. They count as high-intensity work too.

* **Recovery Ride (Zone 1)** – On some days, an easy 30–60 minute spin in Zone1 (HR \~<110 bpm) can aid circulation and flush the legs. These rides should feel effortless. They don’t add much fitness directly (and have negligible TSS), but can help with active recovery. If you’re very fatigued, it’s often better to take a full rest day instead of even a recovery ride.

**Balancing indoor vs. outdoor:** Use the indoor trainer for highly structured workouts (sweet spot, threshold, VO₂ intervals) where controlling wattage is key. The Wahoo Kickr in ERG mode can hold you at target power and eliminate terrain variables. Outdoor rides are great for endurance miles and practicing climbs or sprints in a real setting. For example, you might do a long Zone2 outdoor ride on the weekend, possibly including a sustained climb at tempo, or doing your interval workout on a favorite climb (just be mindful to pace evenly and not overshoot targets due to adrenaline). Using a power meter outside will help keep efforts honest – power is preferable to HR for shorter intervals (HR drifts and lags). Heart rate is still useful, especially for gauging endurance effort (try to stay in your Zone2 HR range on long rides). It also serves as a check on indoor power: for instance, over weeks you might see lower HR at the same power – a sign of improved efficiency.

**Weekly structure example:** Typically, plan **2 quality intensity sessions** (e.g. one VO₂max day, one threshold/sweet spot day) and **2–3 endurance rides**, with other days for recovery or strength training. For instance, a week could look like:

* **Monday:** *Rest Day or Active Recovery.* No cycling (or 30 min Zone1 spin). Option: light core or **upper-body strength** training (since it doesn’t heavily tax the legs).
* **Tuesday:** *Hard Interval Day (Indoor).* Example: VO₂max intervals – 5×4 min at 110% FTP (HR Zone5) with 4 min easy between. Include warm-up and cool-down (total \~1–1.25 hr). This high-dose HIIT early in the week sets a strong stimulus.
* **Wednesday:** *Endurance Ride (Indoor or Outdoor).* 1–1.5 hours Zone2 (low Zone3 on any climbs). If time-crunched mid-week, you could do a shorter 1hr Zone2 ride. Afterward, do your **leg-focused strength training** session (heavy lifts) when muscles are warm – or later in the day. (By pairing leg strength on an easier cycling day, you allow maximal intensity on bike workout days and maximize recovery on the next day.)
* **Thursday:** *Hard Interval Day #2.* Example: Threshold or sweet spot workout – e.g. 2×20 min at 90–95% FTP (HR Zone3–4) on the Kickr, or 3×10 min climbing repeats at FTP outdoors. Total ride \~1–1.5 hr. This workout targets FTP directly after having stimulated VO₂max on Tuesday.
* **Friday:** *Recovery or Rest.* Easy 45 min spin (Zone1) **or full rest**. Could include a short yoga or stretching session for flexibility. Alternatively, this day could be a second upper-body strength training day (keeping it short and moderate intensity).
* **Saturday:** *Long Ride (Outdoor).* 3–4 hours hilly ride in Zone2. Focus on keeping a steady endurance pace on flats and controlling effort on climbs (avoid going all-out on every hill; instead maybe do one or two climbs at a brisk tempo, but otherwise Zone2). This ride builds endurance and specific climbing fitness from accumulated elevation gain. If riding with a group, be mindful not to get dragged into a too-hard pace – remember the polarized principle: **today is your long slow day**. Proper nutrition is key here (eat/drink during ride to stay fueled).
* **Sunday:** *Bonus Ride or Rest.* If you have remaining training time (say Saturday was 3h and you have \~1h left in your 10h budget), do a short easy spin or a fun recovery ride (coffee ride with friends, etc.). Alternatively, take Sunday off entirely to recuperate, especially if Saturday was very taxing. Many masters racers find a 2:1 work\:rest ratio (two days on, one day off) effective for recovery – so listen to your body on whether to ride or rest.

The above is an **example “build” week** with two intensive sessions. In a **pyramidal base week**, you might do only one intense session (e.g. just Thursday sweet spot) and make Tuesday a Zone2 ride, allocating more time to aerobic miles. Conversely, in a very hard **polarized block**, you might include two HIIT days and drastically reduce any tempo riding. **Customize the week to your needs** but maintain the general pattern: a few focused hard days, separated by easier training.

## Strength Training for Climbing Power and Fatigue Resistance

Strength training is a crucial – and often overlooked – component for master athletes seeking performance gains. Our athlete already does strength work (1 leg-focused day for strength, 2 upper-body days for hypertrophy). We will optimize that leg day for maximum cycling benefit, and ensure it integrates smoothly with bike training.

**Why strength training for cyclists?** Building leg strength (especially via heavy resistance exercises) can improve your cycling economy, peak power, and endurance during long efforts. Strength training increases the force your muscles can produce, which benefits climbing (where you often push against gravity at lower cadences) and reduces fatigue over time. Scientific studies back this up: in well-trained cyclists and duathletes, adding heavy strength workouts to the routine improved endurance performance. For example, one study had athletes do heavy lower-body lifts 2× per week; after 11 weeks, the strength-trained group improved their 5-minute cycling power (tested after 3 hours of submaximal riding) by \~7% while the control group saw no change. The strength-trained athletes also showed lower heart rates and oxygen use during the latter part of a long ride, indicating increased efficiency. In short, **heavy lifting made them faster and less fatigued in long events**. Another review notes that to positively affect cycling performance, the strength regimen should involve **heavy loads (around 4–10 rep max)** rather than just light/high-rep training.

**Key principles for cycling strength training:**

* **Focus on Max Strength, Not Size:** We want to recruit and strengthen as many muscle fibers as possible without adding excessive bulk. That means lifting **heavier weights for low-to-moderate reps (4–8 reps per set)**, which develops neural drive and muscular strength more than hypertrophy. For example, squats, deadlifts, or leg presses at \~5RM load will increase force production capacity. This can translate to higher torque on the pedals during climbs and sprints. (Some muscle growth will occur, but heavy low-rep training tends to stimulate more strength than size, especially if overall volume is limited.) High-rep/bodybuilding-style training is less useful for performance – it builds muscle size and endurance, but not the maximal force needed for steep climbs. Studies indicate heavy (and even explosive) training yields the performance gains, whereas just moderate lifting might not.
* **Compound Movements & Core:** Emphasize multi-joint leg exercises that mimic cycling muscle recruitment. Top choices: **Squats** (back or front) – king of leg strength; **Deadlifts** (or Romanian deadlifts) – strengthen glutes/hamstrings and core; **Lunges or Step-ups** – single-leg strength and balance (helps even out left-right power). Do 2–4 sets of each, in the 4–8 rep range at heavy resistance. Also include some core exercises (planks, cable rotations) to improve trunk stability on the bike. A stable core helps you transfer power to the pedals more effectively (think of standing on a climb – strong core keeps you from swaying excessively).
* **Plyometrics (Optional):** If you can perform them safely, adding some plyometric moves (like box jumps or jump squats, low reps) can improve explosive power. These train the muscle fibers to contract quickly – useful for sharp accelerations on a climb. Masters athletes need to ease in carefully (to avoid injury), but a few jumps after strength work can be beneficial.
* **Scheduling:** Do the leg strength session on a day when it least interferes with key rides. Many athletes schedule heavy leg day early in the week or mid-week. For example, doing it on Wednesday (after a hard Tuesday ride) can work: you accept your legs are a bit tired from Tuesday intervals, hit the gym to stimulate strength, then have Thursday hard ride (which may be slightly compromised if sore) – **or**, as in our example week, do strength on Wednesday *after* an easier ride, so that Tuesday and Thursday bike workouts are quality. Another strategy is to do bike intervals in the morning and strength in the evening of the same day – this clusters the hard stimuli and leaves more full recovery days. However, at 47 you should be cautious not to overdo it; splitting into separate days is fine if you allow recovery. **Avoid doing heavy legs the day before a crucial interval session or long ride** – your cycling performance will suffer and injury risk can rise if you attempt hard intervals on fatigued muscles.
* **Frequency & Yearly Plan:** In an ideal scenario, include **2 leg strength sessions per week in the off-season/base (when bike volume is lower)** to maximize strength gains. Once the cycling intensity ramps up in build/race season, you can reduce to **1 session/week** to maintain strength. The athlete already has one dedicated leg day, which is good – keep that year-round if possible. If time permits, a second lighter session (e.g., some bodyweight or core exercises) could complement it, but not at the expense of recovery.
* **Upper Body Training:** The athlete also does two upper-body hypertrophy days. While upper-body muscle doesn’t directly improve cycling power, a strong upper body can aid posture and bike handling (and general health). There is no harm in continuing this, but be mindful that extra muscle mass is extra weight to carry uphill. Since climbing is a focus, you might want to periodize upper-body work too – perhaps maintain strength but avoid excessive muscle gain in-season. Focus on **maintenance** (lower volume, just enough to stay toned and avoid loss of strength) during peak cycling periods. This way you don’t carry unnecessary bulk into climbs. Also, ensure upper body days don’t impair your recovery from bike workouts – if doing heavy bench press leaves you overly sore or tired, scale it back.
* **Link to Climbing:** Heavy strength training **improves fatigue resistance** in climbing by strengthening slow-twitch fibers and increasing recruitment of fast-twitch fibers during long efforts. You’ll be able to grind at low cadence on steep grades with less strain, and kick harder over the top of climbs. Think of it as fortifying your muscular “reserve” – when a long ascent starts to wear you down, stronger legs will hold on longer before failing. Research on masters cyclists and others shows improved **cycling economy** (lower HR for same output) after strength training, which is exactly what a masters climber needs.

**Actionable Strength Session Example (Leg Day):** After a proper warm-up, do:

* 3×5 **Back Squats** (5RM load, full depth if possible) – rest \~2–3 min between sets.
* 3×6 **Romanian Deadlifts** (focus on hamstrings/glutes).
* 2×6 each leg **Walking Lunges with dumbbells** or 2×8 **Step-ups** onto a bench (add weight as able).
* 2×10 **Standing Calf Raises** (optional, for ankle strength if needed).
* Core: 3×30s **Plank** holds + 3×10 **Back extensions**.
  This routine hits all major lower-body muscles. Keep the total session around 45–60 minutes. Strive to increase the weight gradually over weeks as you get stronger. On easier weeks, drop the weight a bit but keep some stimulus (don’t quit strength completely, or you lose the gains). Always use good form to avoid injury – *quality over quantity*.

By integrating this kind of strength work, you’ll likely notice climbing feels different: you can push a big gear at 60 RPM seated without “dying”, or you can stand and accelerate on a steep section with more punch. Over time, heavy training also helps mitigate age-related muscle loss, keeping you powerful into your late 40s and 50s.

## Periodization and Training Progression

To continue improving and reach peak performance at the right time, your training should be **periodized** – organized into phases or blocks that emphasize different targets and include planned recovery. This prevents plateau and overtraining, and ensures you **progress despite limited hours** by intelligently shifting focus and stress.

Key concepts of periodization for our time-crunched master cyclist:

* **Macro Phases (Annual Plan):** If you have a goal event or season (e.g., a big mountain fondo in August), break the calendar into **Base, Build, and Peak** phases. The **Base phase** (often winter/early spring) prioritizes aerobic endurance and strength – lots of Zone2 rides, sweet spot, and strength training, with only occasional high intensity. Next, the **Build phase** introduces more HIIT and threshold workouts to increase FTP and VO₂max, while maintaining some endurance. Finally, a **Peak/Taper phase** shortens volume and sharpens with a bit of race-like intensity, allowing you to come in fresh. If you don’t have a specific event, you can still periodize by doing cycles of training that gradually ramp up intensity/volume, then backing off to consolidate gains.

* **Block Periodization for Intensity:** With only \~8 hours of cycling per week, one strategy is **block periodization** – concentrating your high-intensity work into shorter periods to induce a big stimulus, then using the following weeks for recovery/adaptation. For example, a study on trained cyclists tried a 4-week VO₂max block: in week 1 they did 5 HIIT sessions, then in weeks 2–4 only 1 HIIT per week. The result was superior gains in VO₂max (+4.6%) and power at submaximal intensities (+10% in tempo power) compared to a more traditional spread-out approach. You could mimic this: occasionally (perhaps in late Base or early Build) do a week with three interval sessions (e.g., Tue/Wed/Fri short intense workouts) – this is very demanding, essentially planned overreaching. The following week, scale back to one intense session and more easy riding to recover and let your body adapt to the “shock”. This technique should be used sparingly, but it’s a way to get a big leap in fitness when time is short. **Caution:** At age 47, ensure you’re recovering well if you try a block – monitor fatigue closely (HRV, how you feel) to avoid overdoing it. It might be safer to do a mild version (e.g., 2 extra intense days in a week instead of 5 in the study).

* **Microcycles (Weekly structure over a month):** A common pattern is **3 weeks build, 1 week recovery**. During three build weeks, you gradually increase training stress (either slightly more volume or intensity or both), then the fourth week is a deload with much lighter training. This allows your body to super-compensate and come back stronger for the next block. For example, if you handle 8 hours in week 1, 9 hours in week 2, 10 hours in week 3 (with correspondingly a bit more intensity or TSS each week), then in week 4 drop to \~6–7 hours and cut high-intensity to maybe one short session or none. One source suggests the rest week volume be \~30% less than the preceding week’s (and intensity greatly reduced). After this recovery week, you start a new block at a slightly higher level than the last one. Many masters athletes find a **2:1 ratio** (two build weeks, one recovery week) can work better if recovery is a limiting factor – you can experiment with 2 hard weeks then an easier week if 3 in a row feels too tiring.

* **Progressive Overload:** No matter how you structure weeks, the principle of progression is crucial. Each block or phase, aim to do a bit more than before – either in volume, intensity, or specificity. Since you can’t add more hours beyond \~10, progression might come from adding **interval volume** (e.g., initially 3×3 min VO₂ intervals, later 5×3 min), or adding **interval intensity** (lifting the wattage target slightly), or doing longer sweet spot bouts, etc. Small increments (5–10% increases) in training load can yield continual improvements. Use metrics like TSS or CTL (covered later) to quantify your load and ensure it’s trending upward over weeks (with dips for rest). **But** be careful to increase training stress gradually – masters athletes need to avoid sudden spikes in load, which could lead to injury or overtraining. A ramp rate of +3–5 CTL per week might be appropriate for a well-trained 47-year-old; if you find yourself adding much more, dial it back.

* **Periodize Strength Training:** Early in base, do the heaviest volume of weight training (even 2x/week as mentioned). As the cycling intensity increases in build phase, cut back strength frequency or volume to avoid interference. Before a goal event, shift strength to maintenance mode (low volume, just enough to keep strength) so your legs are fresh for cycling efforts. Joe Friel advises continuing some strength work year-round for masters, but definitely reduce “heavy leg day” in the immediate pre-competition weeks to avoid residual fatigue.

* **Include Variety and Specificity:** Periodization isn’t just about doing more; it’s also doing more specific training as you near your goals. In base, you might do fun cross-training or more general riding. Closer to the season, incorporate training that mimics goal climb efforts or race scenarios (e.g., doing big climbs back-to-back to simulate a mountain sportive). This way, by the time you reach your peak phase, you’re not only fit but also specifically prepared for the demands of your goal.

* **Flexibility in Schedule:** Life happens, especially for athletes balancing work/family at 47. Periodization plans should be adjusted based on how you feel and external stress. For instance, if you get sick or extra busy, insert an unplanned recovery week and resume after, rather than trying to cram through. It’s better to arrive at a key block 90% trained but 100% healthy than 100% trained but burnt out.

In summary, use **periodization to organize your limited training time wisely**: plan your training in blocks with a purpose, gradually build up, then unload to reap the gains. This way, even with 10 hours a week, you’ll see steady improvement and peak when it counts.

## Climbing-Specific Training Strategies

To become a stronger climber, you should incorporate training that addresses the unique demands of uphill riding. Climbing often means **sustained efforts at or above threshold**, sometimes at lower cadences, and requires not just aerobic power but also strength endurance and technique. Here’s how to integrate climbing-specific work into your plan, even with limited hours:

* **Hill Repeats:** If you have access to local hills, use them! Replace some indoor interval sessions with outdoor hill repeats to add real-world specificity. For example, on a threshold day, find a hill that takes \~8–12 minutes to climb. Ride up at your target intensity (say, Zone4/threshold) and note your power/HR. Recover on the way down (easy spin), then repeat for the prescribed number of intervals. The natural grade provides resistance and helps you practice pacing on climbs. Similarly, for VO₂max days, short steep hills (2–5 min climbs) are perfect for those hard efforts – you’ll automatically hit high power to get up the hill. Hill repeats train both the cardiovascular system and the muscular endurance needed for long ascents.

* **Low-Cadence “Muscle Tension” Intervals:** Climbing often forces you into lower cadence (especially if it’s steep or if you stay seated to save energy). You can simulate this with **big-gear intervals** on the flat or trainer. For instance, 2×10 minutes at sweet spot intensity but only 55 rpm cadence. This high torque training strengthens the specific muscle fibers used in grinding up hills. It’s essentially a form of strength training on the bike. Keep good form (engage glutes, stable hips) and don’t let your HR spike too high – it should feel like your legs tire before your lungs do. These intervals can be slotted into a tempo day occasionally. *Caution:* If you have any knee issues, introduce low-cadence work carefully, as it can stress the joints. Ensure you’re thoroughly warmed up and use moderate intensity (not max efforts) when doing this.

* **Standing vs. Seated Climbing:** Practice both, since real climbs will require a mix. Seated climbing is more efficient and relies heavily on aerobic power and muscular endurance. Standing engages upper body and different muscle recruitment (more calves and quads). You might stand for short bursts to relieve muscles or accelerate. You can integrate this into workouts: e.g., during a 20-minute climb, plan to stand for 30 seconds every 5 minutes, or do the last 2 minutes of an interval standing. This will build your ability to generate power out of the saddle without blowing up. It’s also a good way to simulate those moments in a climb where you need to surge (like steep switchbacks).

* **Long Climb Simulations:** If preparing for a big mountain ascent (say a 40+ minute climb in an event), occasionally simulate that in training. This could be indoors – e.g., a continuous 40-minute effort at just below FTP (maybe 90–95% FTP) which is brutal but effective – or outdoors, find a climb or stretch of road where you can ride 30–60 minutes uphill or into the wind continuously. This tests your pacing, nutrition, and mental toughness for long climbs. It’s not something to do every week, but maybe once every few weeks as a confidence builder and to assess your progress (if your power for the same climb or effort increases, FTP likely improved).

* **Pacing and Mental Strategies:** Climbing is as much about smart pacing as raw power. Use training rides to practice *negative splitting* (start slightly conservatively then finish strong) so you learn not to blow up early. Also practice using terrain: e.g., if a climb has varying grade, maybe ease up slightly on the steepest bits to avoid redlining, then push a bit more on the milder sections. Learn what it feels like to ride at threshold vs above, and how long you can sustain different effort levels. This self-knowledge is honed by all the intervals and long efforts you do. Mental toughness can be trained by occasionally doing hard efforts at the end of a ride (simulating climbing when already fatigued). For example, do a 2-hour endurance ride *then* hit a 15-min climb near FTP – this mimics the exhaustion of climbing in the latter part of a race or long ride.

* **Equipment and Posture:** Ensure your *bike fit and gearing* are adequate for climbing. All the fitness gains can be wasted if your gearing is too high (forcing grinding at 40 rpm which can spike HR and fry legs). Consider a compact crank or wider cassette if you find yourself struggling to maintain at least 60 rpm on steep climbs. While not a training method per se, having the right gear lets you execute your training and climbs properly at target intensities. During training rides, pay attention to posture: relaxed upper body, stabilize your core (strong core will help here from your strength training), and pedal smoothly – a round stroke helps on long climbs to distribute load.

* **Integrating with Limited Hours:** Because you only have so many hours, replace generic sessions with climbing-specific ones rather than just adding more. For example, instead of an indoor threshold interval, do it on a climb. Or instead of a flat Z2 ride, ride rolling hills but keep effort Zone2 on average (you’ll naturally go a bit harder uphill and easier downhill – that’s fine as long as you keep it mostly easy). Use your outdoor riding time in the hills wisely: make those 3–4 outdoor hours really count towards climbing improvement by including hills and practicing these techniques.

* **Strength Training Carryover:** As noted, your gym work will help climbing by increasing muscular endurance. To maximize carryover, you can do some hill sprints (anaerobic) which are like a plyometric on the bike, further linking strength to pedaling. For example, after a set of heavy squats the day prior, the next day an easy ride with a few 15-second hill sprints can help translate that neuromuscular power to cycling motion. This isn’t mandatory, but some find it helpful.

By consistently incorporating these climbing-specific practices, you’ll develop a well-rounded ability to handle all types of climbs – whether it’s short punchy hills or long alpine slogs. The combination of increased aerobic power (from intervals), improved muscular strength (from gym and low-cadence work), and better technique will make you a much stronger climber. And crucially, all these can be woven into your 10-hour week; it’s about **quality and specificity**, not extra volume.

## Tracking Progress with Key Metrics

To know if your training is effective, you’ll want to track progress using both performance tests and physiological metrics. The athlete specifically has tools for measuring **FTP, HRV, resting HR, TSS, CTL**, so we’ll focus on those, explaining what they are and how to use them:

* **Functional Threshold Power (FTP):** FTP is roughly the power you can sustain for a one-hour all-out effort (often approximated by a 20-minute test power \* 0.95, or derived from a ramp test). It’s a cornerstone metric for cyclists because it correlates with endurance performance and is used to set training zones. *Tracking:* Test your FTP every \~6–8 weeks (or use estimations from hard workouts/races) to see if it’s rising. An increase in FTP means you can produce more power in steady state – a direct sign of improved fitness and a higher climbing speed (since climbs often are done near FTP). Even without formal testing, note your peak 20-minute or 30-minute power numbers during training – if you set new personal bests, that’s progress. Also monitor how your heart rate behaves at threshold: if you can hold, say, 200 W at a lower HR than before or for longer duration, that indicates improved efficiency. **Goal:** With dedicated training, a realistic FTP gain for an already advanced 47-year-old might be on the order of 3–5% over a training block, though individual results vary. Keep in mind, as you approach your genetic potential, gains slow down – but even a 10 W increase is significant.

* **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** HRV is a measure of the variation in time between heartbeats. In practice, a higher HRV (more variability) generally indicates a state of good recovery and low stress, while a suppressed HRV (lower variability) can indicate fatigue, stress, or insufficient recovery. Many athletes use a smartphone app or fitness tracker each morning to record HRV. *How to use:* Track your baseline HRV trend. When you see a significant drop from your norm or a few days of consistently low HRV, it may be a sign you’re not fully recovered – you might choose to back off training that day or prioritize sleep/nutrition. On the other hand, if HRV is high and you subjectively feel good, it’s a green light to push hard. **Important:** HRV is individual – don’t compare your absolute number to others; instead, watch *trends*. Also, illness or life stress can lower HRV. Some studies have shown HRV-guided training (adjusting workouts based on HRV) can improve endurance performance while avoiding negative outcomes. For you, practically, it means listening to what HRV (and how you feel) tells you about when to go hard or ease up. Over months, if your baseline morning HRV is gradually improving or staying stable while training load increases, that’s a good sign of building resilience.

* **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** This is your pulse when completely at rest (often measured in the morning before getting out of bed). Fit individuals often have a lower RHR (e.g., 50s or even 40s bpm) due to a strong heart muscle and high stroke volume. *Tracking:* Like HRV, watch for deviations. An acute jump in resting HR (e.g., 5–10 bpm higher than normal for a couple days) can signal that you’re fatigued, dehydrated, stressed, or coming down with an illness. It’s a simple metric to check each morning. If your RHR is consistently creeping down over a training block and you feel good, it suggests improved aerobic fitness. However, extremely low RHR combined with fatigue might indicate overtraining – context is key. Use RHR alongside HRV: often with overreaching, you’ll see RHR up and HRV down. That’s a cue to increase recovery. As a master athlete, you might notice your RHR is a bit higher on average than decades ago – but training can still lower it modestly. Aim for consistency and quick return to baseline after hard training (if RHR stays elevated for many days, you likely need more rest).

* **Training Stress Score (TSS):** TSS is a composite number that estimates the training load of a ride based on intensity and duration (with 100 TSS roughly equivalent to 1 hour at FTP). Every workout can be assigned a TSS (your TrainingPeaks or similar software will calculate it from power or HR). For example, a 2-hour Zone2 ride might be \~100 TSS, while a 1-hour interval session could also be \~100 TSS if it’s very intense. TSS helps compare workloads between workouts and weeks. *Usage:* Track your **weekly TSS**. With 8–10 hours of training, your weekly TSS might land around 300–500 (depending on intensity). If one week you shoot up to 600 TSS after averaging 300, that spike could overload you – be cautious. Instead, progress gradually (e.g., 300 → 350 → 400 TSS over weeks). TSS is also useful for planning – if you know you can handle \~400 TSS/week without burnout, try to stay in that ballpark and only exceed during planned overload weeks. Just remember, TSS is an estimate: two workouts with the same TSS can feel different (100 TSS of pure Zone2 vs 100 TSS of VO₂ intervals – the latter is far more taxing on recovery). So, use it as a guide in conjunction with how you feel.

* **Chronic Training Load (CTL) and Performance Management:** CTL is essentially the rolling 6-week average of your daily TSS (with more weight on recent weeks). It’s often called your “fitness” on TrainingPeaks’ performance chart. If you consistently train, CTL rises, indicating higher fitness (and fatigue). Masters athletes need to interpret CTL with their recovery in mind. Typically, younger riders can carry CTLs above 100 easily, whereas masters might sustain a lower CTL due to recovery limits. *Usage:* Monitor your CTL trend over the season. During base, you want CTL to steadily climb (e.g., from 30 up to 60) as you accumulate training. Each hard week adds to CTL, each rest week might cause a slight dip (which is fine). There’s no magic number, but perhaps you find you peak around CTL 80 before feeling burnt out. That might be your individual limit. As a 47-year-old, it’s likely you can’t hit the CTL of your 30s without risking overtraining – and that’s okay. Focus on the trend: are you building up then resting appropriately? Also note **TSB (Training Stress Balance)** if you use it – it’s basically form/fatigue balance. A highly negative TSB (e.g., –30) means you’re carrying a lot of fatigue (often after a big block). Before important events or tests, you’d want TSB to be positive (shedding fatigue while keeping CTL high). You can manipulate training load to achieve that. For now, ensure CTL increases in a controlled way in blocks, and that you give yourself a chance to recover (e.g., drop CTL a bit in rest weeks). This will look like a sawtooth pattern: up, up, up, then a slight down during recovery, then up higher, and so on.

* **Additional Metrics:** While not explicitly listed by the user, consider tracking *power duration for various durations* (e.g., best 5 min power, best 20 min, best 1 min). These are part of your power profile and can show improvements in different energy systems (e.g., if your best 5 min power increases, your VO₂max training is paying off; if your 60 min power increases, that’s your FTP). Many modern platforms will auto-detect when you set a new personal record. It’s motivating to see those PRs, especially for climbing: a higher 20-min power PR likely means you can climb faster. Subjective metrics should also not be ignored: rate your perceived exertion (RPE) in hard workouts and note mood or soreness. Sometimes these predict downturns (e.g., if every interval feels harder than usual or you feel moody and unmotivated, it may signal overtraining brewing).

By tracking these metrics, you create a feedback loop for your training. For instance, if FTP stagnates for 2–3 months, it might mean you need to change stimulus (more VO₂ work, or more volume if possible, or better recovery). If HRV is perpetually low, you may be overreaching chronically – time to dial back. Use data to **inform adjustments**: it takes the guesswork out. Moreover, seeing improvements in numbers can be a huge morale boost and keep you engaged in the process.

Always remember: **the ultimate measure is performance on the bike** (did you drop your buddies on that local climb? Did your century ride feel easier?). Metrics are proxies for performance and guides for training – they’re very useful, but don’t chase numbers blindly at the expense of listening to your body.

## Recovery and Adaptation for Late-40s Athletes

Effective training isn’t just about how hard you exercise – it’s equally about how well you recover. At 47, recovery needs more attention than in one’s 20s or 30s. Your body may need longer to repair muscles, replenish energy stores, and respond to training stimuli. Neglecting recovery can lead to burnout or injury, wiping out your hard-won gains. Here we cover critical recovery strategies (sleep, deloads, flexibility, nutrition) tailored for the masters athlete:

* **Prioritize Sleep:** Sleep is the #1 recovery tool for any athlete. During deep sleep, your body releases growth hormone, repairs muscle fibers, and consolidates adaptations. Masters athletes often have busy lives, but aim for **8 hours of quality sleep per night** as consistently as possible. Research shows that more sleep directly improves recovery and performance. Lack of sleep, on the other hand, elevates stress hormones and hinders muscle repair. Some tips: establish a regular bedtime, create a dark cool sleeping environment, and avoid screens for an hour before bed (to maximize melatonin release). Naps can also help – a 20–30 minute nap after a tough workout or on the weekend can speed recovery. Track your sleep if possible (many devices now give sleep quality scores or you can simply log hours). If you see your sleep drop due to life events, consider adjusting training downwards in that period. **Bottom line:** Guard your sleep like a training session – it’s that important.

* **Nutrition for Recovery:** Training breaks your body down; nutrition builds it back up. Focus on two key aspects: **macronutrient timing** and **quality**. Immediately after hard workouts or long rides, consume a mix of protein and carbohydrates – the carbs refill muscle glycogen and the protein provides amino acids to rebuild muscle. A classic guideline is \~20–30 g of protein and \~1 g/kg of carbs within the first hour post-exercise. This is especially vital if you’ll train again the next day. For example, chocolate milk or a recovery shake, or a meal like chicken with rice, can do the job. For masters, protein is even more crucial: aging muscles respond to protein but may need a slightly higher dose to maximally stimulate repair. Ensure you’re getting **total daily protein around 1.5–1.8 g per kg bodyweight** (roughly 110–125 g of protein for a 70 kg person) spread in 3–4 meals of \~25–30 g each. Don’t shy away from carbs; they are your primary fuel for training and help with recovery energy replenishment. That said, focus on *quality carbs* (whole grains, fruits, vegetables) for overall health and sufficient micronutrients. **Before sleep protein:** Consider a protein-rich snack in the evening (greek yogurt, casein shake, etc.). There’s evidence that protein ingestion before sleep can improve overnight muscle recovery. Hydration is part of nutrition – rehydrate after rides (include electrolytes if you sweated a lot). Chronic dehydration impairs recovery and performance. Lastly, **anti-inflammatory foods** (berries, tart cherry, omega-3 rich fish, etc.) can help reduce muscle soreness. Masters athletes sometimes use supplements like omega-3s (for joint health/recovery) or vitamin D (if deficient) to aid recovery – if diet is balanced, supplements are optional, but ensure no deficiencies (perhaps get blood work periodically).

* **Planned Recovery (Deload Weeks):** We discussed this in periodization – every 2–4 weeks, have an easier week. This is not optional for older athletes; it’s essential. Use recovery weeks to absorb training: cut volume (maybe to \~60–70% of normal) and keep intensity minimal (perhaps one short high-intensity session to keep sharp, or none at all). Embrace these weeks as part of training, not a loss of fitness. Fitness is built when you rest after stress. Many masters athletes actually see breakthroughs *after* a deload week, coming back stronger. A deload doesn’t mean you have to be completely off the bike (though an “off-season” week off can be okay). It just means more easy spins, shorter durations, and fun rides. Use the free time to address other things: extra sleep, maybe a massage or foam rolling session, or doing hobbies to mentally refresh. By scheduling deloads, you reduce risk of overtraining and injuries significantly.

* **Listen to Your Body – Adjust on the Fly:** At 47, you’ve likely learned some intuition about your body’s signals. Pay attention to signs of overreach: persistent heavy legs, unusual joint pains, poor sleep, irritable mood, or stalled performance. If you feel a deep fatigue, don’t hesitate to swap a hard workout for an easy spin or rest day. One missed interval session is far better than a forced effort that pushes you into illness or injury. This is where being older is actually an advantage – you have the wisdom to prioritize longevity and consistency over ego. Use tools like HRV and resting HR alongside subjective feeling to decide if you need an extra rest day. It’s okay to take 2 days easy in a row if needed; you won’t suddenly lose fitness (fitness decays much slower than many think – it takes \~2 weeks of no training to see a significant drop).

* **Flexibility and Mobility:** Cycling is a repetitive motion that can cause muscle tightness (e.g., hip flexors, hamstrings, lower back). Masters athletes often have accumulated stiffness or past injuries. Including even 10–15 minutes of stretching or mobility work a few times a week can pay off. Key areas: **hips** (hip flexor stretches, pigeon pose for glutes), **hamstrings and calves**, **chest/shoulders** (to counter the hunching on the bike), and **lower back** (cat-cow stretches, etc.). Improved flexibility can help you maintain an efficient position on the bike and avoid discomfort on long rides. Consider a yoga session on a rest day or a dynamic stretching routine post-ride when muscles are warm. Foam rolling is another way to massage tight spots (quads, IT bands). While flexibility hasn’t shown to directly improve power, it reduces injury risk and can improve comfort – which means you can train more consistently. Masters cyclists also report that stretching helps them feel “younger” and recover better, possibly by promoting blood flow.

* **Injury Prevention:** Address little issues before they become big. If you feel a niggle in the knee or back, don’t ignore it. Maybe back off the specific activity that aggravates it (e.g., reduce low-cadence grinding if knee pain, or check your bike fit). Use recovery modalities as needed: icing a sore knee, doing physical therapy exercises for a known weak point, etc. *Prehab* (preventive rehab) is the name of the game. Strength training we included is a big plus here – it not only boosts performance but also fortifies your joints and connective tissue. Ensure you use proper bike fit to minimize repetitive strain (for example, saddle height and cleat position can affect knee tracking).

* **Mental Recovery:** Recovery isn’t just physical. Balancing work/family and training can be mentally taxing. Give yourself mental breaks too. That might mean an easy ride with no structure, just enjoying scenery (helps remind you why you love cycling). Or taking a day off to go hike or do something different. High levels of mental stress (job deadlines, etc.) will compound physical stress. During those periods, consider adjusting training down, or using more mindfulness/relaxation techniques (meditation, deep breathing) to manage stress. It all feeds into recovery because your body perceives stress holistically. High life stress can slow your exercise recovery (as seen in elevated cortisol, suppressed HRV). Thus, a holistic approach is warranted: healthy lifestyle, not just training, makes a faster cyclist.

* **Nutrition and Weight for Climbing:** A brief note on body composition: as a climber, your power-to-weight ratio is key. While training will increase the “power” side, you might consider if there’s room to safely optimize the “weight” side by losing unnecessary fat (if applicable). Many masters athletes have a few extra pounds that could be trimmed, but do this carefully – **avoid crash diets** which harm recovery. Instead, focus on high-quality foods, slight caloric deficit in base period if needed, and adequate protein to preserve muscle. Even a 2–3 kg fat loss (if currently above ideal race weight) can noticeably improve climbing speed. However, do not sacrifice health for marginal gains; fueling workouts is the top priority. Often, when training intensity goes up, weight may naturally come down as long as you eat clean and to appetite.

In essence, think of recovery as **the third leg of the stool (training, nutrition, recovery)** that holds up your performance. Especially in the late 40s, you can still make impressive gains – but you must out-recover your younger self. Many masters athletes actually thrive by training smarter, not harder: they use all these recovery techniques to get more quality out of each hour of training. By sleeping well, eating right, and resting when needed, you’ll bounce back stronger after workouts and consistently hit those training targets. Remember, **fitness = training stress + recovery** – neglect the latter and the equation falls apart. Take recovery as seriously as you do your intervals, and you’ll be on your way to new personal bests on those climbs.

## Sample 4-Week Training Block (Putting It All Together)

To illustrate how all these elements come together, here’s a **structured 4-week masterclass training block** for our athlete. Let’s assume this is a Build phase block aiming to raise FTP and climbing ability. The schedule maximizes 10 hours/week, includes strength, and follows a 3:1 week loading (3 build weeks, 1 recovery week):

**Week 1 – Build (Approx. 8.5 hours, 400 TSS)**

* **Mon:** Rest day (off bike). *Strength: Upper body hypertrophy.* Light stretching.
* **Tue:** VO₂max Intervals (Indoor, 1h 15m, \~90 TSS) – e.g. 5×3′ at 115% FTP (Zone5), 3′ recoveries. Cool down well.
* **Wed:** Endurance Ride (Indoor, 1h, \~50 TSS) – Zone2 easy spin. *Strength: Heavy legs in PM* (squats, etc., as outlined).
* **Thu:** Threshold Climbing Repeats (Outdoor if possible, 1h 30m, \~100 TSS) – Warm up, then 3×10′ climb at FTP (Zone4 HR), 5′ easy between. Cool down home.
* **Fri:** Recovery spin (0h 45m, \~20 TSS) – Zone1 flat spin or off if tired. *Strength: Upper body hypertrophy/core.*
* **Sat:** Long Ride – Climbing Focus (Outdoor, 3h 00m, \~150 TSS) – Hilly route. Ride mostly Zone2, but do 2×15′ climbs at sweet spot (upper Zone3) within the ride. Practice fueling (consume carbs hourly).
* **Sun:** Medium Ride – Tempo Endurance (Outdoor, 1h 45m, \~80 TSS) – Rolling terrain, ride Zone2 with a few bursts: include 2×8′ tempo (Zone3) efforts on moderate hills. Or, if fatigued, make this a pure Zone1–2 recovery ride.

*Notes:* Week 1 includes two hard interval days (Tue/Thu), a solid long ride, and \~2 strength sessions. Total intensity is \~20% of volume. Athlete monitors HRV – by Sunday HRV is slightly down, but within normal.

**Week 2 – Build (Approx. 9.5 hours, 450 TSS)**

* **Mon:** Rest or very light recovery ride (0h 30m). No strength (or gentle yoga).
* **Tue:** VO₂max Intervals (Indoor, 1h 10m, \~85 TSS) – 6×2.5′ at 120% FTP (Zone5+), 3′ easy between. Short but very intense.
* **Wed:** Endurance (Indoor, 1h 15m, \~60 TSS) – Zone2 only. *Strength: Heavy legs.*
* **Thu:** Sweet Spot Interval (Indoor, 1h 30m, \~95 TSS) – 2×20′ at 90% FTP (high Zone3), 5′ easy between. Include 5′ of high-cadence spinning after intervals to flush legs.
* **Fri:** Rest day (off bike completely). *Maybe light core work.* Prioritize sleep.
* **Sat:** Long Endurance (Outdoor, 3h 30m, \~160 TSS) – Big ride. All Zone2 (keep a lid on intensity because you loaded some intensity mid-week). Aim \~3–4 hours, focusing on steady power on flats and steady HR on climbs (even if it means using easier gears than usual).
* **Sun:** Hill Sprints + Endurance (Outdoor, 1h 45m, \~50 TSS from sprints + \~30 TSS endurance = 80 TSS) – Ride to a short hill and do 5×30″ all-out sprints uphill (these are anaerobic, >Zone5, full recovery between). Then spin easy for remainder of ride (total \~90 min). These sprints recruit those fast-twitch fibers. If overly fatigued, skip the sprints and just ride easy.

*Notes:* Week 2 increased a bit of volume on Sat. Two intense sessions plus a few explosive sprints. The athlete feels a bit more tired by Sunday – maybe noticing higher resting HR. Still manageable, but looking forward to next week’s lighter load.

**Week 3 – (Lighter Build / Taper for test, \~8 hours, 300–350 TSS)**

* **Mon:** Rest day.
* **Tue:** Threshold Check (Indoor, 1h, \~70 TSS) – After warm-up, do a 20-minute **FTP test** or a hard sustained effort to gauge progress. Aim for a personal best average power. (Alternatively, do a long climb outdoors as a test). Record average HR and power. Cool down thoroughly.
* **Wed:** Very easy recovery ride (0h 45m, \~20 TSS). No strength (give legs a break after test).
* **Thu:** VO₂ Booster (Indoor, 0h 45m, \~50 TSS) – 3×3′ at VO₂max intensity (Zone5) just to keep sharp. Not an all-out session, volume is low.
* **Fri:** Rest day. *Light stretching.*
* **Sat:** Long Climb Simulation (Outdoor, 2h 30m, \~120 TSS) – Do a continuous 30–40′ climb (or equivalent on flats/trainer) at a strong pace (\~90% FTP) to build confidence for sustained efforts. Otherwise Zone2 for rest of ride.
* **Sun:** Recovery spin or fun easy ride (1h, \~30 TSS). Keep it strictly easy.

*Notes:* This week is slightly lighter *by design*, allowing a test and some recovery. It’s not a full recovery week, but intensity is reduced. The FTP test on Tuesday is a hard effort but short in duration. The rest of week is mostly easy, apart from a mini climb challenge on Saturday (which is sub-threshold, not maximal). The athlete sees how the test compares to prior FTP. Suppose FTP improved by 5 W – that’s a win! Also, by end of week 3, fatigue is low and motivation is high.

**Week 4 – Recovery Week (Approx. 5–6 hours, <200 TSS)**

* **Mon:** Off. Massage or foam rolling session.
* **Tue:** Zone1–2 spin (0h 60m, \~30 TSS). Very relaxed.
* **Wed:** Off or cross-train (e.g., swim or walk).
* **Thu:** Zone2 ride (1h 30m, \~60 TSS). Maybe ride with a slower friend or enjoy scenery. Keep HR <75% LTHR.
* **Fri:** Off. *Optional gentle yoga.*
* **Sat:** Easy social ride (2h, \~70 TSS) – flat route, keep power/HR low. Sprint for the town sign if feeling frisky, but mostly chill.
* **Sun:** Off, or short easy spin if really itching to ride (<=30m).

*Notes:* The goal of Week 4 is full recovery and consolidation. CTL will dip slightly, but that’s fine. No structured intervals, just easy movement. By the end of this week, the athlete’s HRV is back up high, resting HR normalized, legs feel fresh. This sets the stage to either start another build block the next week or perhaps go into a race/peak if this was a pre-competition taper.

This sample block demonstrates how to juggle intensity, volume, strength, and rest. In practice, you’d adjust the exact sessions based on personal response (for example, if the athlete struggled in week 2, we might have made week 3 an earlier recovery week). It’s a dynamic process. But the core ideas hold: **a few key workouts, lots of supporting easy workouts, and strategic recovery.** The schedule also respects the 10-hour limit (notice in recovery week we only used \~6 hours, essentially “saving” some hours that could be redistributed to busier weeks if needed).

## Conclusion

By following this structured approach, our 47-year-old cyclist can make substantial gains in climbing and FTP on a limited schedule. We combined the best of both polarized and pyramidal training – plenty of Zone2 endurance riding with well-placed high-intensity sessions – to maximize aerobic development and high-end power. We’ve included specific workouts from sweet spot intervals to VO₂max repeats, all mapped to the athlete’s heart rate and power zones for precision. We integrated heavy **strength training** to bolster muscular power and fatigue resistance, a proven boon for climbing performance. We outlined how to **periodize** training into blocks and use progressive overload despite time constraints, including when to push and when to back off. We detailed **climbing-specific techniques** (like hill repeats and low-cadence work) to ensure training directly translates to better uphill prowess. We also highlighted key **metrics** – from FTP tests to HRV and CTL – so the athlete can monitor progress and adjust intelligently, taking advantage of tools and data. Finally, we put a big emphasis on **recovery**: sleep, nutrition, rest days, and listening to the body, because at 47 recovery is the limiting factor that we can turn into a strength with proper care.

With disciplined execution of this program, the athlete should expect to see their power-to-weight ratio improve, climbs that once were grueling will become steadier and faster, and FTP should increase as the weeks go by. Perhaps most importantly, by training smart – focusing on quality, consistency, and recovery – the athlete will stay healthy and motivated. The evidence-backed methods in this masterclass ensure that every one of those 10 hours a week contributes maximally to performance, proving that **you don’t need endless hours, just the right strategy, to get “fast after  Forty”**. Now it’s time to put it into action: train hard, recover harder, and enjoy dropping some younger riders on the climbs! **Happy Training!**
