# From Firefighting to Leading: Transformative Video Training Tactics 📹

Are constant user errors putting your team in non-stop crisis mode? 

If you’re a Chief Learning Officer or trainer, I bet you’re all too familiar with the stress and frustration of trying to keep up. 

This relentless firefighting isn't just exhausting—it’s eating away at your team’s morale and your resources. Worse yet, if it keeps up, you might start losing customers and falling behind the competition. ✨

Let’s break the cycle! Here’s how you can get back on track:

📌 Quick Access Video Libraries: Create a go-to repository of video tutorials that users can easily access whenever they need a hand.

📌 Update Videos Regularly: Keep your video content fresh and aligned with the latest system updates.

📌 Scheduled Refresher Videos: Regularly send out video refreshers to keep everyone up-to-date and in the loop.

Taking these steps can help you move from constant damage control to strategic progress, boosting team morale and enhancing the user experience along the way.
