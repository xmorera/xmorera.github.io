# Can You Help Me on My New Pluralsight Bio? 🤵

It's been 12 years since I started creating content for Pluralsight. Given my "corp" background, I've always had a very adult-like and formal bio in my profile page, which you can check out right here: https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/xavier-morera

But given that I have a more "joyful and friendly" personality (not my words), I've decided to updated it a little bit.

With 20 years in the training industry and over 350,000 learners trained, I have proven that video training boosts engagement, revenue, retention, and satisfaction. Clients see improved performance and ROI, with one company cutting support time by 70%, saving 2,100 man-hours annually, and another seeing a 40% increase in platform use.

I deliver hands-on video training with expert insights, ensuring learners grasp and apply knowledge effectively. This guarantees impactful and enjoyable experiences.

Recently, I crafted a quick guide, “Training: The Key to Making Money or Saving Money”, which I designed to help you enhance learning outcomes and drive business success.
