# Why Do I Do What I Do? 💡

Sometimes it is important to remember why you do what you do. 

In my case, I have over 20 years of experience in the learning and development space, having created and delivered trainings for many companies which include Microsoft, Intel, HP, Cloudera, Pluralsight, and more. Over 350 000 learners have taken my online training courses and I've delivered in-person training to engineers for many enterprises all over the world.

💥 I am extremely passionate about what I do, which is share with everyone what has taken me years to learn. 

My goal is to explain the complex in a simple way. That's what I do, every single day... sitting by myself in my small office in Costa Rica.

During this time, I have seen firsthand all the problems that companies that create trainings face: it is time consuming and slow process, expensive, hard to keep content up to date, dependency on voice actors, and more. 📉

That's why I took all of my experience and with my company created an AI-driven platform that generates videos directly from text/PowerPoint/Google Slides, in minutes, and with an up to 80% cost reduction. 

💎 The platform that we built, www.Lupo.ai, solves many of the main pain points that enterprises face when creating training content.  

We are the other piece of the puzzle that allows your customers to create great content quickly, at scale, and in a very cost effective way. 

Please let me know if you would like to talk about training and customer education programs. I'll be thrilled to talk to you. 👌
