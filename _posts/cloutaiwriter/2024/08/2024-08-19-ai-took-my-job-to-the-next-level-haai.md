# AI Took My Job (To The Next Level): HAAI 💥

We've all heard the buzz about AI taking over jobs like it's the plot of a sci-fi movie. 

But seriously, how much of this is fact and how much is just the stuff of Chicken Little's The Sky Is Falling?

Do you actually know anyone who's been fired by a robot? 🤖

Can #AI really replace humans, or is there more to the story here?

Sure, AI has the potential to automate some tasks (looking at you, data entry), but the reality is more like a buddy cop movie than a horror flick. 

AI isn’t about pushing us out of the picture—it's more about teaming up to make the impossible happen.

This is what I like to call Human Assisted Artificial Intelligence or HAAI (I heard a phrase with these terms but don't know if this is a thing). ✳

HAAI combines the power of artificial intelligence with human expertise to deliver exceptional results.

Let’s face it, jobs that require creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving are as safe from AI as your grandma’s secret cookie recipe. 

According to the World Economic Forum, while robots might swipe 75 million jobs by 2022, they’re also expected to create 133 million shiny new ones. 

That's right—more jobs, not fewer!

The Oxford Martin School and PwC might have some scary numbers (like 47% of U.S. jobs at risk of automation), but here’s the kicker: a whole new world of job opportunities is popping up, especially in fields like #datascience, AI development, and #machinelearning. Industries are hungry for pros who can ride this wave and make friends with the bots.

So, what’s the game plan? Make AI your sidekick! 

Upskill, flex those human muscles (the metaphorical ones), and embrace the chance to collaborate with these high-tech helpers.

That's the part where I am trying to help, by creating courses @ Pluralsight that help people get one of those 133 million new jobs. 

These two might definitely help (but there are many more):

1️⃣ Core Concepts of Generative AI for Developers --> https://www.pluralsight.com/library/courses/generative-ai-developers-core-concepts/

2️⃣  Choosing Generative AI Tools and Technologies --> https://www.pluralsight.com/library/courses/choosing-generative-ai-tools-technologies/

In the end, AI isn't here to kick us out—it's here to give us a leg up. The trick is to adapt, evolve, and see AI as the ultimate power-up, not a game-over screen.

Will AI replace us? 

My bet: Nope.

Will AI help us? 

100% yes.

Now, let’s turn the tables—how can we make AI work for us? Share your thoughts in the comments! ⬇
