# Training Matters for Customer Satisfaction: Pay Attention To Forbes, Not Me 🎯

I found this article from Forbes called "Three Customer Experience Strategies To Improve Customer Satisfaction And Loyalty", which point 3 (shown in the image) called my attention but also reminds me of one of the things that confuses me the most—one of the greatest ironies that I've encountered.

Here's the deal. I've been in training for over 20 years and there are two things that I see over and over and over again:

💥 1. Training is one of the most straightforward ways to increase revenue or save money. 

Why? Because if you train your customers properly, they will be able to use your products and services better, thus potentially consuming more of them, renewing contracts, or expanding their purchasing. Also, if you train your employees, they will be better equipped to serve your customers, which again brings in more money or may save money.

But...

💥 2. Typically, training is never seen as a priority. It is either an afterthought: "Oh crap! Our customers are not using our product" or " we have a bazillion support tickets open! Help!".

Even worse, sometimes it is seen as an expense instead of an investment that has a clear and measurable ROI.

For example, one of our customers spent about 3000 hours a year servicing support tickets. After we helped them create video training for their customers, now they are only spending about 1000 hours a year.  

That's over 2000 hours saved, which is measurable in terms of $$$$ saved. 

Then my question is, why do enterprises don't make training an integral part of their process?

Tell me. Am I wrong? 💡
