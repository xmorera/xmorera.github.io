# How Pluralsight Changed My Life Twice 🚀

“Skills speak louder than words”

Indeed they do, but the “actions” part is step 2 once you get “skills”.

This is the story of how skills + actions with @pluralsight changed my life TWICE.

💥 Let me tell you why

I’ve been in training since around 2002, when I co-created and delivered the 32-bit to 64-bit migration labs for Microsoft, HP, and Intel while working at Artinsoft.

We were teaching enterprises all over the world how to migrate their code from 32-bit processors to 64-bit. This was part of an initiative led by Microsoft and since Artinsoft created the VB6 to VB.NET migration assistant, we got a chance to help companies worldwide migrate their code. 💡

The effort was called Route 64, and we got a chance to train companies of all sizes while traveling the world (the travel part was fun, check out a list here:

One of the locations where we gave our trainings was Building 20 in Microsoft’s main headquarters in Washington.

At the time, there was a small company giving trainings in Building 20 as well. Who knows, maybe I even crossed paths with some of its founders back then.

At the time, Pluralsight was instructor-led training–the online part had not been born yet. A few years later, it did and that’s when my life started changing. 📢

I became a subscriber and started working on my skills, which helped me become a better programmer and engineer.

💎 This was life-changing moment #1 for me.

My skills improved and I kept getting better at what I did which also allowed me to help some of my peers one-on-one whenever they are stuck in their work (something I still do and enjoy today).

One day I had an idea, what if the things I am teaching and helping my peers with… what if… I create video trainings that I can then share?

So I sent this mail in their ticketing system. 👨‍💻

They replied a month or so later and I started my auditioning process to become a Pluralsight author.

🎇 This was life-changing moment #2.

I got accepted and started working nights and weekends creating trainings until I was able to fire myself from my day job and dedicate myself to work on my passion… creating trainings!

And so more than 350 000 learners have taken my courses since then and my passion for teaching flourished!
