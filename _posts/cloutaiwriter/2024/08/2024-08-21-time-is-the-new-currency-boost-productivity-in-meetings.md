# Time is the New Currency: Boost Productivity in Meetings ðŸ’¥

Feeling like there aren't enough hours in the day? 

You're not alone. 

ðŸ•˜ But the issue often lies in how we manage our time, not the amount we have.

There is time that we should dedicate to "doing", which you should protect fiercely and there is time that should be dedicated to planning and collaborating or what we call "meetings".

Meetings are a double-edged sword that disrupts productivity but is crucial for teamwork.  ðŸŽ¯

Just remember that a 1 hour meeting is not "1 hour for the company". If 10 people attended, then that meeting is actually 10 person-hours for the company. 

Side note: Just do the math of what each person costs per hour and you can get an estimate of the cost of a meeting. Add all of them through the year and the cost will be most likely astronomical!

Here's how to make meetings more efficient:

âœ³ Focus on Results: Prioritize tasks and invest your time wisely. Remember, being busy doesn't equal being productive.

âœ³ Protect Your Time: Minimize distractions like unnecessary meetings. Developers especially need uninterrupted focus to create and debug software.

âœ³ Make Meetings Matter: Only invite essential participants. Have a clear agenda with objectives, and stick to it!

âœ³ Schedule Strategically: Plan meetings for the beginning/end of the day or before/after lunch to safeguard core productive hours.

âœ³ Establish Working Agreements: Set team schedules with "core working hours" where minimal interruptions occur.

âœ³ Balance Talkers and Doers: Encourage participation from quieter team members who have valuable insights.

âœ³ Actionable Outcomes: End meetings with clear decisions or next steps to avoid analysis paralysis.

By following these tips, you can transform meetings from time-wasters into effective tools for collaboration and maximize productivity for both developers and managers.
