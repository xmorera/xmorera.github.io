# Yes It Is The Same Shirt and The Fit Fat Fit Book 🏋️‍♂️

A couple of days ago I shared a post on how I lost a whole bunch of weight and improved my health significantly. Just check out the picture. It is literally the same shirt! 

TL;DR; I went from 103 kgs to 71 kgs (230 to 156 pounds), which is 43% fat to 16% fat. I am now writing a book on how I did it.

📩 After that post I got a few DMs asking me how I did it and what was I planning to include in my book. 

Just to be clear, I did not go through gastric bypass surgery and I did not use any fat loss pills!

🚴‍♂️ I simply started doing a bunch of cycling, working out, and more importantly, started following a nutrition plan. 

I learned at 45 that you get abs in the refrigerator, not the gym! 🥗

Now the other part is what do I plan to include in the book. The table of contents is included below, but I have a few questions to for you as well. Send me a DM or comment below. Also, tag someone that might have good insights for me.

💥 Do you have any advice for me that I should follow? 
💥 What worked for you? And what didn't?
💥 What else would you like included in the book?
