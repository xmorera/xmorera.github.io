# Update Smarter: Using AI to Keep Training Videos Relevant 📹

Struggling with the endless cycle of updating training videos? 

You're definitely not alone. Every training manager knows the drill: the constant need to keep content fresh piles on the stress and can lead to serious burnout. 

The stakes are high with outdated content, from causing operational inefficiencies and safety risks to potentially opening up your organization to legal issues. You can't afford the fallout from not keeping your training videos current.

Here's how to streamline the process and ensure your training videos are always up-to-date:

🚀  Adopt an AI Video Platform: Automate the update process for your training videos using AI technology, which can quickly refresh content to reflect the latest standards and information.

🚀  Utilize Templates: Use templates to standardize the look and structure of your training videos. This makes updates faster and more consistent across all training content.

🚀  Implement Real-Time Editing Tools: Equip your team with tools that allow for immediate edits to training videos, ensuring timely updates and accurate information.

🚀  Schedule Regular Reviews: Establish a fixed schedule, such as monthly or quarterly, to review and update all training videos, making sure they remain relevant and effective.

With these strategies, you can enhance efficiency, improve understanding, and maintain confidence in your training programs.
