# Why Do We Forget About Our Health... Until It Is Too Late? 💥

Check out this picture. On the left, it is younger me at 31 years old and extremely obese. The other picture is me at 46, quite fit if I may brag.

From about 103 kgs to 71 kgs (230 to 156 pounds). 43% fat to 16% fat. And don't even get me started on my cholesterol and prediabetic state.

📢 What happened. 

Well, the story of what happened that took me from fit to fat to fit is something that I am currently writing in a book called:

"Unfatting Myself: Getting Fit in Your Middle Age 🏋️‍♀️

A Comprehensive Guide to Health, Fitness, and Nutrition (Or How to Lose Weight as a Busy Individual That Knew Nothing About Nutrition)"

But long story short,  I basically worked myself not to the bone but to a very unfit and pretty fat state. 

👨‍💻The "always on" work culture and the pressure to meet deadlines and the downplaying of self-care, made me prioritize work over health, neglecting sleep, exercise, and even mental well-being, creating a cycle of stress and fatigue that was impossible to break.

I basically made a drastic change last year and now my fitness is top notch which ironically has made my productivity skyrocket. 👌

Has something like this occurred to you? Are you doing something about it? 

Tell me more, I would like to know everything you can tell me about your own personal story. 

And I will be sharing soon the progress I am making on my book as I would like to help other knowledge workers like me improve their lives.
