# Use AI to Speed Up Training Development 🤖

Feeling swamped by the task of developing training programs with hardly any time or resources? 

I totally get it—the stress and frustration of juggling your day-to-day responsibilities while trying to craft effective new employee training can be overwhelming.

If we ignore this, we risk seeing lower productivity, costly mistakes, and a higher turnover rate. Nobody wants that.

Here’s a straightforward plan to help streamline your training development:

🚀 Use AI-Driven Video Creation Tools: Tap into the power of AI to quickly create engaging training videos.

🚀 Repurpose Existing Content with AI: Don’t start from scratch. Refresh and update what you already have using AI.

🚀 Edit Quickly with Feedback: Keep your training up-to-date and effective by swiftly adjusting based on feedback.

These steps can make a big difference, leading to well-trained employees, growing productivity, and higher morale.

With 20 years in the training industry and over 350,000 learners trained, I have proven that video training boosts engagement, revenue, retention, and satisfaction. Clients see improved performance and ROI, with one company cutting support time by 70%, saving 2,100 man-hours annually, and another seeing a 40% increase in platform use.

Recently, I crafted a quick guide, “Training: The Key to Making Money or Saving Money”, which I designed to help you enhance learning outcomes and drive business success.
