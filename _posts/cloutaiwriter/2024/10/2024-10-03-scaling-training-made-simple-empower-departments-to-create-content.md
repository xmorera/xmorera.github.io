# Scaling Training Made Simple: Empower Departments to Create Content 🚀

Relying too much on just a few key people to create your training materials? 

Yeah, that can really slow things down and mess with your ability to scale up. It puts unnecessary pressure on your team and can lead to gaps in your training development. 🔥

It’s a costly problem: slow adaptation, falling behind the competition, and stifling innovation.

Here’s a better approach to lighten the load:

🔵 Make Everyone a Creator: Use AI video creation platforms to empower your whole team, not just the experts.

🔵 Department DIY: Encourage different departments to take charge and create their own content.

🔵 Collaborate on Video: Take advantage of tools that let everyone contribute to video projects, making content creation a team effort.

🔵 Automate Editing: Let AI handle the heavy lifting of video editing to save time and cut down on the need for specialized skills.

By switching things up, you’ll see faster adaptations, better scalability, and a boost in innovation.

Has your organization found effective ways to overcome these bottlenecks in training material development? I’d love to hear about your strategies. Share them below! ⬇️

With 20 years in the training industry and over 350,000 learners trained, I have proven that video training boosts engagement, revenue, retention, and satisfaction. Clients see improved performance and ROI, with one company cutting support time by 70%, saving 2,100 man-hours annually, and another seeing a 40% increase in platform use.

Recently, I crafted a quick guide, “Training: The Key to Making Money or Saving Money”, which I designed to help you enhance learning outcomes and drive business success.
