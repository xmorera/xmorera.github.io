# The Importance of Learning Culture in a Team 📚

There is now a premium on intellectual curiosity and the desire and ability to quickly grow and adapt one’s skill set. 

How can you create a learning culture on your own team or in your organization? 

💡 Reward continuous learning - note that rewarding curiosity is not just about praising and promoting those who display an effort to learn and develop; it’s also about creating a climate that nurtures critical thinking, where challenging authority and speaking up are encouraged, even if it means creating discord. 

💡 Be sure to give people meaningful and constructive feedback - it's hard to improve on anything if you are unaware of your limitations. 

💡 Lead by example - if you want to nurture your team’s curiosity or unlock learning in your organization, you should practice what you preach.

💡 Hire curious people - if you hire people who are naturally curious and maximize the fit between their interests and the role they are in, you will not have to worry so much about their willingness to learn or be on their case to unlock their curiosity.
