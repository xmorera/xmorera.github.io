# Role of Learning in Society 🎓

We learn from the day that we are born. We learn how to walk, talk, and even eat with a spoon. We keep learning until the day we leave this world.

📖 It has been like this since early human history. Several early civilizations that established tribal schools... one of the earliest one in Ancient Mesopotamia, in the Sumerian city of Nippur, some 2000 years ago.

More learning centers have existed in ancient India, Rome, China, and Greece. In fact, the Lyceum was a temple where many philosophers taught things that are still valid today. Fast forward many years and in 1088 the oldest continuously running university was founded, in Bologna, Italy. A few years later, Oxford was founded as well which is better known in the higher education world. And many more have been founded through history, all over the world. 🌍

There is no doubt about the important role that universities play in human history.

🌟 Nowadays there are thousands of universities worldwide, with India having more than 5000, Indonesia 33 hundred, the USA has a little over 3000, and Costa Rica less than 100. But there is one thing.

Regardless of the fact that we are living in times of great technological advancements, many of these universities are still following the same learning methods, where students sit in a classroom, they receive instructor-led training, they do some homework, and take tests to get a pass or fail score. 👨🏻‍🏫

But times have changed and video is used more and more for learning.

Humans are consuming ever more in their personal devices, which means that learning on your own, once you leave the classroom is becoming more the norm than the exception.

That's why I created Lupo.ai, to revolutionize how companies create video content. 📹

🎯 Lupo is a software as a service platform that enables the creation of training and learning videos and tutorials in a standardized, scalable, collaborative, multi-language, and cost-effective way.

🎯 Lupo is my Ikigai. It is the intersection of my passion, my skills, and how I can give back to the world.
