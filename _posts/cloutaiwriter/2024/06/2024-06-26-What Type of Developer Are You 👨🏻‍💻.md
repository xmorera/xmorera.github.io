# What Type of Developer Are You? 👨🏻‍💻

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, understanding the various roles developers play can help businesses better manage projects and foster team growth. 

Developers are often categorized based on their experience, skill set, and responsibilities. Let's delve into three primary types of developers: Junior Developers, Senior Developers, and Technical Decision Makers. 🌟

I've been in all of these positions at one point or another of my career and given how I've had many hats, depending on the technology that I am working on or the company I am working with,  here is what I have to say about each one of these roles:

✅ Junior Developers are typically thought as being at beginning of their tech careers, having less than three years of professional coding experience. They often require guidance and have a more learning-oriented job role. 

Yeah, but when I change role I feel like I am a junior again and this is not bad! Being a junior has its advantages as juniors sometimes tend to learn more and faster.

✅ Senior Developers have typically been in the industry for over five years and possess a deep understanding of programming principles and practices. They are expected to handle complex projects with minimal supervision.

Whenever I feel senior, I remind myself that technology change quickly and without notice! It is important to be willing to learn, always! 

✅ Technical Decision Makers are not just senior developers but are often team leads or IT executives who guide the strategic direction of projects and make pivotal technology choices. They might have decades of experience in the field.

Being a technical decision maker is a great responsibility as the future of the applications and services relies heavily on their input. 

From the enthusiastic and learning-focused junior developer to the strategic and decision-focused technical decision maker, each type of developer plays a vital role in the software development ecosystem. Understanding these roles can help in structuring teams that are balanced, dynamic, and effective, ensuring that projects not only start strong but also adapt and evolve over time to meet ongoing business needs.
