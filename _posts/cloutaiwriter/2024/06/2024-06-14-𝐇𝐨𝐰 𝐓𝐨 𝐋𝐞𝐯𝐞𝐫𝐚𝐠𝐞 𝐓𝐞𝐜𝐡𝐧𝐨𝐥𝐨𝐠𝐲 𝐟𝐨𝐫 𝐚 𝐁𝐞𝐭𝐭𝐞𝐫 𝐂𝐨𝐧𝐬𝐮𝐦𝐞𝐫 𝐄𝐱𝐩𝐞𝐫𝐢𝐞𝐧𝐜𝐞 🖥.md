There's no doubt that technology has had a huge impact on the way consumers interact with brands. To keep up with the ever-changing landscape, companies are turning to technology in new and innovative ways to better connect with their customers.

When considering technology, keep these tips in mind:

🔲 Define your consumer base first – before implementing new technology, consider how customers use your business; that should guide your tech choices.

🔲 Start small if you need to, but have options for growth – if you start small with technology, make sure it's adaptable and can grow with you as your business expands.

🔲 Technology should always serve a purpose – tech for tech's sake can be detrimental to your business instead of helpful. Identify a need for it first.

🔲 Be the consumer before implementing new tech – an important step in adopting new technology is to "shop" other similar businesses to see what you like (or don't like) about their technology.
