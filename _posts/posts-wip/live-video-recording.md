## Session 2 - At Vita’s (Audio Test)
The purpose of this session was to test primarily the audio. Better audio was achieved using the Rode Filmmaker Kit

### Audio settings (mic)
Best sound achieved using the TX at 0 and RX at minus 20 db

### Notes from PE (Dallin)

> …start at the absolute middle of the whole set-up (camera audio levels). So turn both the RX and the TX to 0 then put the camera recording level in the middle. If you’re still getting that slight hiss (for which the technical term is “Noise Floor”), then turn the recording level on the camera down to the first or second notch and don’t change anything on the RX or TX. If you’re too quiet or still not happy with the overall sound, hit the +20dB switch on the RX and try that.
