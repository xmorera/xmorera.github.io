# Why Training is the Best Investment Your Business Can Make 

The number of years I've been in training is "drinking age legal". Yeap I am that old and that's why I picked an image from about 20 years ago for today's post, when I was delivering a 64-bit migration training in Korea for Microsoft.

During all this time, there are plenty of things that I learned about training, but there are two that stand out because of the irony that they create.

The first one is that training is one of the best investments that a business can make.

But the second one is that a large number of business, despite the obvious benefits, don't prioritize training or even worse, they take training for granted.

Indeed when businesses think about investments, training often gets overlooked in favor of some flashy new tech or a bold marketing campaign. 

But here’s the truth: training is one of the most impactful investments your business can make—and it’s time to give it the spotlight it deserves.  

- The Ripple Effect of Training  
Training isn’t just about teaching new skills; it’s about unlocking potential. 

When employees are well-trained, they’re more confident, productive, and engaged. A study by LinkedIn found that 94% of employees would stay at a company longer if it invested in their learning. By nurturing your team, you not only retain top talent but also boost morale and productivity, creating a stronger foundation for your business.  

There's even a joke that I've heard many times: "if you are worried that you train your employees and they leave, it may be worst. If you don't train them, they will most likely stay."

It doesn’t stop there. Training extends to your customers too, just that they are sometimes called "customer education programs".

Educating your customers on your products and services ensures they get maximum value, which increases satisfaction, builds loyalty, and reduces churn. An educated customer is an empowered customer—and they’re far more likely to stick around and advocate for your brand.  

- Training = Revenue Growth
The financial benefits of training are undeniable. Companies with comprehensive training programs report 24% higher profit margins than those without. Why? Because a knowledgeable workforce works smarter, not harder. They innovate, solve problems efficiently, and drive growth.  

Similarly, customer education programs can lead to increased revenue by driving product adoption. When customers understand your product’s full capabilities, they use it more effectively and are more likely to upgrade or renew services.  

- The Hidden Cost of Skipping Training
The flip side of the coin is costly. Without training, employees can become disengaged, turnover rates soar, and productivity plummets. For customers, a lack of education can lead to frustration, missteps, and ultimately, higher churn rates.  

The reality is, investing in training is far cheaper than the costs of losing talented employees or dissatisfied customers.  

- Training is a Strategic Advantage   
In today’s fast-paced world, businesses that prioritize learning gain a significant edge. They adapt faster, innovate better, and build stronger relationships with their teams and customers. Training is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity for staying competitive.  

If you want to see real growth, it’s time to view training not as an expense but as a strategic investment that pays dividends for years to come. Empower your employees. Educate your customers. The returns will speak for themselves.  

And that's why the mission of our platform Lupo is "make education accessible to everyone".
