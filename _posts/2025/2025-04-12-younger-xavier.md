```
younger me if I could sit you down right now I'd tell you something that would change everything but I know you
wouldn't believe me not yet because right now you you think you have it figured out you think the life you've
built will hold that if you just keep going if you just work hard enough push
long enough prove yourself enough everything will eventually settle into place you think identity is something
solid but who you are today is simply Who You Are are but one day you will
wake up and something will feel a off at first you won't be able to name it it
won't be a disaster nothing catastrophic will happen but there will be a feeling
yet a quiet persistent unease beneath the surface of everything the life you
built the one you worked so hard for will still be there the career the
achievements the relationships the structure but something about it will feel different like a suit that once fit
perfectly but now feels tight around the shoulders restricting unfamiliar and you won't understand why so you will do what
you have always done you will push harder set bigger goals chase the next
Milestone thinking that if you just achieve more earn more prove yourself more the feeling will go away but it
won't because this isn't something you can fix it's something you must face
younger me I need you to listen very carefully now because no one is going to warn you about this you've spent your
life building you constructed an identity you created a version of yourself that the world would accept
respect admire you made choices based on what was expected of you what was
practical what was rewarded you believe that if you built the right life you would eventually feel whole but one day
you will wake up and realize that the self you spent years creating is not the self You Were Meant to keep this is
where most most people panic they mistake it for a crisis they think they have failed that something is wrong with
them that they need to Double Down correct course work harder but Jun understood what was happening he knew
that the first half of life is about construction building an identity establishing yourself seeking security
and and that's necessary but he also knew something else something far more
important at a certain point that identity the one you worked so hard to build is meant to fall apart because the
person you created to survive the first half of life is not the person you were meant to stay and if you resist that
change if you try to hold on to the version of yourself that no longer fits you will suffer not because you are
broken not because you made a mistake but because you are being called to something greater younger me I know how
terrifying that sounds I know what it feels like to watch the life you built start to feel unfamiliar to feel like
you are losing control to question everything you once believed about success about meaning about who you are
and I also know that if you don't understand what is happening you will waste years fighting it you will do
everything in your power to hold on to the career the habits the identity you
will cling to what is familiar even as it stops making sense and you will wonder why none of it feels right
anymore but younger me this unraveling it is not the end it is the
beginning and I've brought six people with me today six Minds who understood what most of us don't realize until it's
too late Carl Jung who saw the collapse of the old self not as a crisis but as a
transformation friederick nicher who knew that to become something greater you must first destroy what holds you
back Victor Frankle who proved that meaning is not something you find it is
something you choose Alan Watts who warned that the biggest mistake we make is believing life is a journey when it
is actually a dance Carl Rogers who understood that real change comes not from fixing yourself but from finally
accepting who you are and senica who left behind the most important lesson of
all that time is not something we lose but something we waste they knew
something younger me something I wish I had known before everything began to fall apart because when you finally
reach that moment when the the self you built begins to break down you will face a choice and the life you are meant for
it begins the moment you stop trying to hold
[Music] on younger me you've spent your whole
life believing that if you work hard enough if you build the right life if you achieve enough one day you'll
finally feel complete that's the promise they sell you isn't it that's that the right job the right
house the right relationships will eventually bring you peace that success will silence your doubts that
achievement will erase the fear that maybe just maybe you were never enough
to begin with Carl Yung spent his life asking one question why do so many
people feel lost at the peak of success his answer was Radical the identity you
spent decades crafting the one that brought you stability recognition belonging was never meant to
last or it was only ever the First Act for a while it will serve you in fact it
has to the first half of life is about building you create an identity that fits the world you learn who you need to
be to survive to belong to be accepted you play the role you wear the mask you
build a life that makes sense one that looks good from the outside and for a
time it works until one day it doesn't it won't happen suddenly uh it won't be
dramatic it will start with a quiet feeling a whisper in the background of your thoughts a sense that the life you
built no longer quite fits and that's the part no one warns you about you spent so long believing that if you just
climbed high enough if you just proved yourself enough if you just followed the script you'd feel at peace but suddenly
you don't you'll tell yourself it's just a phase that you need a new challenge
it's a bigger goal a change of scenery and you'll double down thinking that if you just push harder the unease will go
away but it won't because this isn't a crisis and it's an
initiation Jung spent his life studying why people feel lost in midlife he
discovered something that explains why so many successful intelligent capable people suddenly find themselves
questioning everything he called it the two halves of Life the first half of
life is about construction uh it's about building the self an identity that works
in the world this just you seek security approval success you learn the rules and
play the game and and you believe with every fiber of your being that if you do everything right you will be rewarded
with fulfillment but the second half of life it demands something entirely different
the first half is about building the second half is about letting go and this is where people struggle because no one
tells you that the self you spent decades creating was never meant to be permanent that it was only ever a
necessary First Step but younger me this is the part I need you to hear you're
not breaking down as uh you're breaking open the questions that frighten you the
uncertainty that unsettles you they aren't problems or they are signs that
something greater is trying to emerge some people feel this shift early some later and some never do but for those
who sense it the message message is clear the life you've built is not enough not because it was wrong but
because it was incomplete and this is where people make the mistake that cost them years some panic and double down on
the old path they chase bigger goals hoping success will quiet the unease
they tell themselves that if they just keep going the doubt will fade doer others abandon everything they tear down
their life overnight thinking that reinvention will solve the problem they search death desperately for an answer
they can't quite name but Yung would tell you neither of these paths lead where you need to go the second half of
life is not about chasing it is about integrating it is about becoming whole
and that starts with a single terrifying act honesty you must stop filtering your
thoughts to be acceptable stop ignoring what unsettles you stop explaining away
the feeling that something is missing you must notice what triggers you in others because those are often the parts
of yourself you have buried you must sit with the thoughts you avoid write them
down say them out loud face them question them understand them and slowly
you will start to feel whole Yung called this process individuation the Journey of becoming
who you truly are instead of who you were told to be and it is not easy
because to accept yourself fully you must face the parts of you that you don't like and if you don't if you
ignore the shift and pretend everything is fine that's when your Shadow takes over the shadow is the part of yourself
you hide the anger you suppress the desires you deny the emotions you buried
because they felt too dangerous to bring into the light and and if you don't face it it will rule you from the dark it
will twist your desires into addiction turn your unspoken fears into bitterness
at the world make you resent others for the very things you refuse to see in
yourself this is why so many people in midlife feel lost bitter or Restless
they are fighting an enemy that is inside them but here's the secret Yung wanted you to know the shadow is not
your enemy it is your missing half everything you've buried the doubts the
ambition the sadness the rage it didn't disappear it's waiting for you
and if you have the courage to turn toward it instead of running away you will find that everything you've been
looking for was hidden there all along Yung once said the most terrifying thing
is to accept oneself completely but it is also the most liberating because the
moment you stop fighting yourself you realize you were never broken you were simply
unfinished and now at last you have the chance to become whole
[Music]
younger me I know you're afraid afraid of change afraid of Letting Go and uh
afraid that if you stop being who you've always been you'll have nothing left you've built your life carefully piece
by piece you've worked to be someone someone respectable someone accomplished
someone who others recognize and yet despite all that deep down you sense something isn't right you tell yourself
it's just a phase that you'll shake it off that if you just keep moving forward
it'll pass but it won't because this feeling it isn't a mistake it's a
warning nature believed that growth is an act of rebellion the self you are
today is not your final form but here's the catch transformation is not about
waiting for change to come it's about tearing down the parts of yourself that no longer serve you and rebuild building
again and again until what remains is unshakable the idea that the person you are today is not the final version of
you that you were never meant to stay the same that your job is not to protect the identity you've built but to break
it apart and rebuild it over and over again until what remains is something
unshakable but here's the part no one wants to hear growth is violent that's transformation does not come gently it
does not arrive as a Moment of clarity under soft candle light real transformation destroys you first it
burns away the things that are small the things that are weak the things that keep you caged this is why so many
people stay trapped because when they feel the destruction coming the unraveling of who they were they Panic
they try to hold on they cling to their old selves mistaking comfort for peace
but nature knew the only way forward is through you must be willing to destroy who you were to make space for who you
are meant to become that doesn't mean throwing everything away it doesn't mean erasing your past it means looking at
yourself every habit every belief every assumption of what and asking does this
serve who I am becoming or is it just something I'm afraid to let go of maybe
younger me you spent years chasing achievements thinking that if you just accomplish enough you'll finally feel
worthy but n would ask you what if the person chasing those achievements was never really you maybe you've built a
life that looks good from the outside but doesn't feel right on the inside but nchu would ask what if the reason it
doesn't feel right is because you've outgrown it maybe you've spent years avoiding risks avoiding failure staying
safe but n would ask what if playing it safe has only kept you small you have to
be willing to tear down the parts of yourself that no longer serve you and that younger me is terrifying because
for years you have mistaken that old self for your foundation but but the truth is it was only scaffolding and at
some point if you want to build something real you have to be willing to knock it down the world tells you that
if you've built something stable you should hold on to it that if you've made it this far you shouldn't risk losing it
that the person you are today is the person you are meant to stay but that is a lie nature believes
believed that the greatest people in history were not those who played it safe but those who dared to die to their
old selves and Rise Again stronger he called this becoming the Uber mench the
higher self not a person who is perfect or Flawless or Untouchable but a person
who has stopped waiting for permission a person who has stopped looking to others to tell them who they should be a person
who has let go of who they were yesterday to make room for who they must become tomorrow but how do you do it how
do you let go of the old self when it is all you've ever known first you must be willing to sit in the discomfort change
is uncomfortable because it forces you to confront the possibility that you were wrong wrong about What mattered
wrong about who you thought you were wrong about what you believed you wanted
but nature would remind you being wrong is not the problem clinging to an old
truth when you've outgrown it is second you must learn to see destruction as
creation most people fear change because they only see what is being lost but n
understood that the fire that burns the old self away is the same fire that forges the new self the pain of letting
go is not the pain of loss it is the pain of transformation and third you must be
willing to walk alone because when you begin to change people will resist it
they will try to pull you back to who you were they will ask why you can't just be the person they knew but nature
would tell you that is not your concern your task is not to be who they need you
to be your task is to become who you were meant to be younger me I need you
to understand this the fact that you are questioning who you are is not a sign of weakness duh it is a sign of growth the
fact that you feel lost is not a sign that something is wrong it is is a sign that something new is trying to emerge
if you feel like your old self is crumbling don't fight it let it this is
not the end this is the fire that will Forge you because the greatest version
of you the one who is free the one who is alive the one who is unbreakable is waiting on the other side but first you
must be willing to burn
younger me I know you're searching I you wouldn't call it that not yet you'd say
You're Building something your career your future your life you'd say you're
working hard so that one day you can finally enjoy what you've earned but
deep down there's a quiet fear you haven't put into words what if after everything you still feel empty Victor
Frankle had everything taken from him his family his home his freedom but in
the darkness of a Nazi concentration camp he uncovered a truth that would change the way we understand The Human
Experience meaning is not something given to you it is something you choose
and that choice it is what determines whether you survive for years you have
believed that happiness is something you achieve that if you work hard enough earn enough succeed enough one day you
will have arrived and for a while it feels like like you're getting closer the promotions the recognition the
Milestone they bring a rush a sense of accomplishment as that but the feeling
never lasts does it no matter how much you achieve there's always something missing that is because happiness is not
something you can chase it is something that happens when your life is aligned with meaning Frankle learned this in the
worst place imaginable a Nazi concentration camp stripped of everything his family his career his
freedom and yet in the middle of that horror he made a discovery that would change how we understand The Human
Experience he noticed something the people who survived who endured the unimaginable
weren't necessarily the strongest or the smartest or the fittest they were the ones who had found something to live for
a reason to wake up each morning meaning not pleasure not Comfort not happiness
because here's the truth younger me a life without meaning will always feel empty no matter how much you try to fill
it this is why midlife feels Hollow for so many people not because something is
wrong with them but because the things that once gave their life meaning have faded the job that once felt like an
exciting challenge now feels like routine the Ambitions that once kept them going now feel exhausting the goal
HS they spent years chasing now feel pointless but this is where most people
panic they think maybe I need to work harder at least maybe I need to achieve more maybe I just haven't reached the
right goal yet but Frankle knew that the ones who spend their lives chasing happiness never find it because
happiness is not a goal uh it is a byproduct and the thing that creates it
is meaning so what do you do when life feels meaningless sir how do you create
meaning when you feel lost Frankle discovered that meaning comes in three ways through work not just a job but a
purpose something that contributes to the world something that outlives you
through love not just romantic love the kind of love that makes life Rich deep
friendships kindness shared experiences the people who make you feel seen
because younger me if you have no one in your life who truly knows you you're not really living yet
and through suffering this is the hardest to understand but it is the most powerful when pain enters your life and
it will you have a choice you can let it break you or you can use it some of the
most purpose-driven people in the world the ones who seem unshakable the ones who Inspire others they didn't have easy
Liv they had suffering but instead of letting it Define them they turned it into something greater uh Frankle
himself self said when we are no longer able to change a situation we are challenged to change ourselves um that
is what meaning is younger me it is not something you find it is something you
create and if you ever feel like life has lost its meaning look at these three things and what are you creating who are
you loving B what suffering are you transforming because the moment you answer those you will never feel lost
again [Music]
younger me I know how hard you're trying you wake up every day with a plan a
to-do list a strategy you measure your progress set your goals map out the next
step convinced that if you just keep pushing forward one day everything will come together you tell yourself that
when you finally arrive when you have the right job the right house the right life
then you'll be happy Alan Watts saw something that most people never realize
not until it's too late the greatest lie we've been told is that life is a journey that it has a destination we are
taught from childhood that life moves in a straight line that if we just follow the right step study hard build a career
start a family accumulate success one day we'll reach a moment when everything finally makes sense when we feel
complete but Watts knew this was an illusion he saw that people spend their
entire lives chasing a future that never truly arrives always striving always
waiting always believing that fulfillment is just one more Milestone away and in doing so they miss the only
thing that is ever real the present younger me Watts wasn't just a
philosopher he was a man who dedicated his life to exposing the hidden assumptions that keep people trapped in
a cycle of endless striving he understood that the greatest mistake we make is treating life like a task to be
completed instead of an experience to be lived and when you finally understand what he saw the way you move through the
world will never be the same again because here's the truth no one tells you every time you reach the next goal
and the next Milestone the next success it will feel good for a moment but then the feeling Fades and so
you set another goal thinking this will be the one this will finally make you feel whole but it never
does does it that's because you've been living as if life is a journey one with a final destination where everything
will finally make sense but what saw something different he saw that life is
not a journey at all life is a dance a dance has no Finish Line no place where
you are meant to arrive the purpose of dancing is never to reach the end
it is to move to feel to experience every step along the way and yet younger
me you've been treating life as if it is something you must Master as if every moment is just another step toward the
next you've been racing toward a future that does not exist and the reason you
feel Restless younger me the reason you feel like no matter how much you achieve It's never enough is because you are
still chasing a future that does not exist no one ever told you to stop uh no
ever told you that you were already here um from the time you were a child you were told just do well in school um then
just get a good job but then just settle down oh then you
just retired at what point younger me did anyone ever tell you to Simply Be
This is why so many people after achieving everything they were supposed to still feel empty because they were
never taught how to live only how to prepare for the next stage uh you are
not here to get someone you are here to be here but younger me I
know what you're thinking if life isn't about progress then then what's the point if I stop striving won't I just
fall behind uh watts would tell you you cannot fall behind in a dance a journey
has an end goal a place you're trying to reach but a dance you don't dance to get
somewhere you dance because the movement itself is the point this is what no one teaches you that the the purpose of life
is not to arrive somewhere it is to fully experience where you already are
but here's the problem you have spent your whole life believing that control is the answer that if you just plan
enough work enough prepare enough you can predict what will happen next and
Whats would warn you that is an illusion because no matter how much you plan no
matter how much you fight for certainty life will unfold in ways you cannot expect and if you spend your life trying
to control what happens next you will never be fully Alive where you are now so what do you do how do you stop
chasing a future that doesn't exist first younger me you must stop treating
Life as a means to an end do something today not because it will get you somewhere but because you love it now
second let go of the illusion of control you do not control life you do not
control time the only thing you control is how present you are in this moment
and third stop waiting stop waiting for permission stop waiting for the right
conditions stop waiting for the moment when you finally feel ready to start living because wats would tell you you
are already living younger me you have spent years looking ahead searching for
a future moment when life will finally feel whole but wats would ask you what
if nothing is missing what if you you have been whole all along What If instead of searching for something more
you simply allowed yourself to be here and now because the life you are waiting for
is already
happening younger me I know you've spent years trying to be the right kind of person uh the kind who fits in the kind
who is liked the kind who never makes people uncomfortable and for a long long
time you convinced yourself that this was who you really were but let me ask you something when was the last time you
felt truly free because Carl Rogers spent his life studying what makes a life feel real and he discovered
something that most people never realize something that explains why so many people wake up one day and don't
recognize themselves anymore the further you stray from your true self the more lost you become but
uh and that is what's happening to you younger me you keep waiting for something to click you keep thinking
that maybe if you just work harder achieve more prove yourself enough
you'll finally feel whole but you won't because the problem isn't that you
haven't done enough the problem is that you aren't being yourself Rogers called
it congruence when the person you are on the inside finally matches the life you live on the outside and here's the truth
younger me that is the only way you will ever never feel free but what if you don't know who you really are what if
you've spent so long being what others expect that you've lost touch with yourself Rogers had an answer for that
too the first step is to stop censoring yourself pay attention to the moments
when you adjust your words your tone your opinions just to fit in ask
yourself if I wasn't afraid of judgment what would I say the second step is to notice what excites you the things that
pull at you even if don't make sense uh the interests you dismiss the parts of yourself you keep in the dark that is
your real self trying to get your attention and the third step radical
self-acceptance because real change the kind that lasts never comes from fixing
yourself in arson it comes from accepting yourself so fully that the things that aren't meant for you start
falling away one day younger me uh you will reach a point where pretending is
exhausting where saying yes to things you don't want showing up in places you don't belong and living a life that
doesn't fit becomes unbearable and when that day comes I hope you remember what Roger said the
Curious Paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am then I can change
younger me you've been waiting for permission to be yourself but you don't need permission you only need courage
because the moment you stop pretending is the moment you start living
younger me there is something you believe that is more dangerous than any mistake you will ever make more
deceptive than any failure you will ever fear you think you have time you tell
yourself that there's always tomorrow that one day you'll finally slow down
that one day you'll start living the way you always wanted but there was a man who saw through this illusion thousands
of years ago a man who watched the wealthiest most powerful people in Rome
Wast their lives believing exactly what you believe now the his name was senica
a philosopher a Statesman an adviser to Emperors but more importantly a man who understood the one truth that most
people never learn until it's too late he saw people chasing success chasing power chasing everything except the one
thing that truly mattered their time he watched Men build Empires hoorde
fortunes conquer Nation only to reach the end of their lives and realize they had spent everything except
their days wisely and he left behind a warning one that should shake you awake
senica would tell you that is the greatest lie you will ever believe you don't have time not in the way you think
you see most people don't realize this until it's too late life is not short but we make it short we waste years on
things that don't matter we live as if time is an endless Resource as if we can spend it carelessly and still have
enough left for the things that truly count we tell ourselves that we'll enjoy life later when things settle down when
we have more money when we have more freedom but senica warned you act like Mortals in what you fear and like
Immortals in what you desire you fear death as if it could happen at any moment but you waste your days as if you
were going to live forever younger me you don't have forever and that is not meant to frighten you it is meant to
wake you up because the real tragedy is not that life ends the real tragedy is
that most people never truly live you see people misund understand what wasting time really means they think
wasting time is doing nothing sitting still resting relaxing but that's not what
senica meant you don't waste time by doing nothing you waste it by doing the wrong things by spending years chasing
approval instead of meaning by living for other people's expectations instead
of your own by filling your days with distractions obligations and noise while
neglecting the things that actually make life worth living and one day younger me
if you are not careful you will wake up and realize that you traded your time for things that never really mattered so
what do you do how do you stop wasting the only life you have there first you must stop postponing your life stop
telling yourself that you'll do the things that matter later later is not promised second you must ask yourself
one simple question If today were your last would you be satisfied with how you spent it
and because the truth younger me is that one day you will wake up and it will be
your last and on that day you will not wish you had spent more time at the office you will not wish you had made
more money you will not wish you had impressed more people you will wish for
more moments with the ones you love you will wish for more days spent doing the
things that made you feel alive you will wish for one more chance to live fully
instead of merely existing but by then it will be too late
younger me the life you are waiting for is already happening and the time to start living it is now because the only
day that ever truly belongs to you is this one we've explored six of the
greatest Minds Yung n Frankle Watts Rogers and senica but now I want to hear
from you which one of them spoke to you the most which idea hit you in a way you
weren't expecting was it yung's insight about the self you must let go of n's
challenge to destroy and rebuild frankl's Revelation that meaning is something you choose or perhaps it was
what's reminder that life is not a journey but a dance maybe it was Roger's call for radical self-acceptance or
senica's warning that we waste the very time we fear losing tell me in the comments what which of these thinkers
change the way you see your own life and more importantly why and one more thing
there are countless Minds throughout history who have wrestled with these same questions questions of meaning
identity transformation and time who should we explore next what other
thinkers philosophers or psychologists have shaped the way you see the world drop their names in the comments because
journey of understanding doesn't end here and the next great conversation might start with you
