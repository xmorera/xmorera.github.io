# Practical AI Tools You Can Actually Useâ€”Starting Now

![AI becoming practical in enterprise](/images/2025/practical-ai-tools-you-can-actually-useâ€”starting-now.jpg)

AI just took another step out of the lab and into real workspaces.

Three major developments this week prove that generative AI is now a tool for doersâ€”not just dreamers:

1. **The U.S. Army launched "Ask Sage"**, a secure Enterprise LLM Workspace integrating OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, AWS, and open-source models. It even wrote its own launch statement.
   **Why it matters:** Sensitive government workflows like reclassifying 300,000 job descriptions can now happen in days instead of years.

2. **Zencoder released "Zen Agents,"** enabling dev teams to create, share, and collaborate using custom AI agents.
   **Why it matters:** Streamlines coding, automates repetitive work, and fosters team-wide innovation.

3. **HPE and NVIDIA expanded their partnership**, offering private AI clouds pre-loaded with Blackwell GPUs.
   **Why it matters:** Enterprises can now deploy powerful AI systems with minimal setup and faster time-to-market.

Weâ€™re watching AI shift from hype to hands-on productivity.

ðŸ‘‰ Which of these tools would most impact your workflow?
