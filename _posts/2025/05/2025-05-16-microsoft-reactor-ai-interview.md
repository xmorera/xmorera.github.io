# Interview: Microsoft Reactor as Founder of AI First Company

A few weeks ago I got an email from Microsoft Founder's Hub saying they were looking for founders of companies trying to make an impact in the world with AI. They wanted to interview these founders for their Microsoft Reactor program. I was thrilled to be selected as one of the founders to share my insights on the impact of AI agents in education and training.

Finally, last week I had the amazing opportunity of being interviewed by Microsoft Reactor about the impact of AI agents and how we're using them at Lupo.ai to transform education and training.

Training is often an afterthought for many companies, yet it’s crucial—directly impacting revenue through customer education and significantly cutting costs via effective internal training. At Lupo, we're leveraging generative AI to effortlessly convert documents and presentations into engaging, multilingual educational videos.

They had a very interesting question. When everyone adopts AI, what will differentiate us? 

The answer is "simple": Human creativity, originality, and ethical application. 

Routine tasks will become commoditized, making authentic innovation essential. Trust and quality will become even more valuable in a sea of AI-generated content, driving personalized, meaningful interactions.

They also asked me if I had one AI birthday wish, what would it be?

I wish for an AI agent that instantly transforms any knowledge into personalized, accessible lessons, removing all barriers—technical, linguistic, and geographic. Imagine a world where anyone, anywhere, can teach and learn effortlessly. 

Actually, more than a wish, this is our mission at Lupo. We aim to create a world where knowledge is universally accessible and learning is a seamless experience for everyone.

At Lupo, we're committed to democratizing learning, ensuring opportunity is distributed as equally as talent worldwide.

I'd love to hear your thoughts—how do you see AI reshaping education or your own industry?
