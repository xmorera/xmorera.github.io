# MLGuru.ai as AI Playground

Yesterday I started telling you the story of how almost 20 years of experience creating training along with a bunch of tools used for automating parts of my video training creation for Pluralsight and Cloudera, eventually became Lupo. 

But what I didn't tell you is where www.mlguru.ai fits into the picture. Here's the story.

The minute we completed the challenge and created the first version of Lupo, our fresh and newly minted AI-driven platform for video training creation, we knew that we had something of value, but as any new company we did not have any customers... yet.

But here is the thing. How do we test a platform in as close scenario as the real world without risking making a mistake with real customers?

I guess a lot of companies or at least founders like to break things and move fast. 

However, I am a bit more risk-averse and perhaps that's why I move usually a bit slower than other people. I like to move solidly forward, take one step, assess results, move forward a bit more, rinse, wash, and repeat. Also, I was not very sure where to start looking for customers outside of those companies that I worked for in the past.

So, what can we do? That's when we decided to create our very own application called mlguru.ai, which would be a website that would teach the wonderful world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

Since it was ours, we could experiment as much as possible converting content into video. We designed it as those "chose your adventure" books, where videos would be created and learners could follow along. We designed the site for customized paths, and personalized videos. 

Then we got started, but very quickly we got our first customer... Accenture! 

I can say that we got a really nice start as we were able to refine our platform, which was designed inspired on Cloudera's NGPS (Next Generation Publishing System) plus my Pluralsight production workflow with the world's biggest IT company, Accenture.

That's quite a start.

And now, in honor of MLGuru.ai, I am going to write for a while about everything AI and ML related, to make good use of all that content that we created for our test.
