# Why Video is the Best Format for Training Today

In todayâ€™s digital world, training needs to be fast, engaging, and accessible. Traditional methodsâ€”lengthy manuals, slide decks, or in-person sessionsâ€”often fall short. Video, on the other hand, has emerged as the most effective way to train employees at scale.

Believe me, I know it. 12 years and 50 courses at Pluralsight have shown me this, time and time again.

Hereâ€™s why video should be at the core of your training strategy.

1. Video Increases Engagement and Retention
People process visual content 60,000 times faster than text, making video one of the most effective learning tools. Studies show that employees retain 95% of a message when they watch it in a video, compared to just 10% when reading text. Interactive elements, animations, and real-life demonstrations make learning more dynamic and memorable.

2. Video is Scalable and Cost-Effective
Live training sessions are expensive and time-consuming, requiring instructors, venues, and travel. Video eliminates these costs. Once a training video is created, it can be shared with unlimited employees, at any time, anywhereâ€”without additional expenses. Updates are also easier; instead of redoing entire courses, businesses can quickly modify or replace outdated segments.

3. Video Supports Remote and Global Teams
With remote and hybrid workforces becoming the norm, companies need training that works across different locations and time zones. Video enables asynchronous learning, meaning employees can learn at their own pace, reducing the need for scheduled training sessions. Additionally, subtitles and multilingual support make video accessible to global teams.

4. Video Makes Complex Topics Easy to Understand
Some processes are difficult to explain with text alone. Video can break down step-by-step workflows, demonstrate software, or simulate real-world scenarios in a way that static content simply canâ€™t. This is especially useful for technical training, compliance programs, and onboarding new employees.

5. Employees Prefer Video
The modern workforce is used to consuming video content. Whether itâ€™s online courses, YouTube tutorials, or workplace training, employees expect interactive, visually engaging learning experiences. If training is dull, it wonâ€™t be effectiveâ€”video keeps learners interested and motivated.

The Future of Training is Video
Companies that embrace video-based learning see higher engagement, better retention, and reduced costs. Itâ€™s scalable, accessible, and aligns with the way employees prefer to learn today.

If youâ€™re still relying on outdated training methods, itâ€™s time to make the switch. Your employeesâ€”and your bottom lineâ€”will thank you. ðŸš€
