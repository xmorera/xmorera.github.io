# Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI is a rapidly growing field that is changing the way we live and work. But what exactly is AI, and how does it work? Let's spend a few minutes learning about what AI is and how it can help us.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence, or AI for short, is the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans. These machines use algorithms and data to make decisions, solve problems, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks can include understanding natural language, recognizing images, playing games, and even driving cars.

One of AI's key elements is the machine's ability to learn and improve over time. This is known as machine learning, but we will discuss it later.

The term Artificial Intelligence or AI appeared for the first time in 1995 when emeritus Stanford Professor John McCarthy defined it as:

"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines" — John McCarthy, 1995.

However, almost 60 years before McCarthy, Alan Turing thought computers could do more than execute instructions. Turing believed that one day, computers would be able to figure out those instructions independently.

“could a computer go beyond “what we know how to order it to perform” and learn on its own how to perform a specified task. Could a computer surprise us? Rather than programmers crafting data-processing rules by hand, could a computer automatically learn these rules by looking at data?” — Alan Turing, 1938.

Artificial Intelligence is much more complex than it seems at first glance, and many companies misuse it or confuse it with Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
