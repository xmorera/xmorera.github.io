Training is one of the most underused growth drivers in business. Despite being a $360B+ market, most training is still created manually — slow, costly, and hard to scale — or with AI tools that create edutainment, not real education. That’s the problem Lupo.ai solves.

Lupo is an AI-first company that uses generative AI to turn your existing content into training videos in minutes. Lupo is a scalable, cost-effective, and repeatable solution fit for thousands of organizations modernizing how they train, effectively shifting the training market. Early adopters include Accenture and DHL.

I’m Xavier Morera, a trainer with over 380,000 learners on Pluralsight and experience building programs for Microsoft, EY, and Cloudera — the foundation Lupo is built on. After 20+ years making complex topics easier to learn, I’m now building the technology to scale that impact — with a long-term vision to improve lives through accessible, high-quality training.
