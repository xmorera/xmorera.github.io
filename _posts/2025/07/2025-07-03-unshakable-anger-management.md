If you get angry often—and don’t have much time to read—this is your book.

Anger doesn’t mean you’re broken. It means you’re human. But if left unchecked, it can derail relationships, cloud judgment, and rob you of peace.

That’s why I wrote *Unshakable*. It’s a no-fluff, fast-read guide to help you regain control when the world pushes your buttons.

Inside, you’ll find:

* The science behind emotional reactions—and how to override them
* Techniques to pause, breathe, and respond with intention
* Tools to stop being hijacked by others’ actions
* Everyday habits to build real emotional resilience

This book was born from personal experience and countless conversations with people under pressure. If you’re looking for practical tools to master your emotions and stay calm in chaos, I hope *Unshakable* helps you do just that.
