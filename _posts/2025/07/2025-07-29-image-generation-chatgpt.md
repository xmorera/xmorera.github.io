We live in extraordinary times. AI isn’t just changing how we work—it’s redefining what we can achieve.

As professionals, we're expected to wear multiple hats—writing, analyzing, coding, designing—all while meeting the same tight deadlines. Expectations have evolved, even if timelines haven't.

That’s why I created this course for Pluralsight: **Creating, Refining, and Publishing AI Images in ChatGPT**.

Inside, you'll discover how to:

- Generate high-quality visuals from natural language prompts  
- Iterate quickly using prompt rewriting and visual feedback  
- Edit existing images with branded elements and layout tweaks  
- Build consistent, story-driven image sets for campaigns and presentations  
- Adapt visuals across formats with ease  
- Navigate ethical and legal considerations in publishing AI-generated content

With ChatGPT, you don't need to learn new software or wait for design resources. You simply describe what you need, refine it through conversation, and get results in seconds.

This course walks through the entire workflow—from concept to campaign—showing how to use AI as a creative partner.

The tools are available to everyone. What sets you apart is how you use them.

I'm Xavier, transforming how we learn—one AI-powered course at a time.
