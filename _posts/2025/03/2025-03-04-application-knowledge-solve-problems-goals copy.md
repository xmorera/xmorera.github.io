# How Accenture Solved Self-Service Video Creation using AI

![debug console](/images/2025/debug-console.png)

A software platform that no one knows how to use is a dead platform. An application that your users know how to use is a thriving application.

That's why video training is so important—actually they are called "customer education programs".

However, creating video training is time-consuming, potentially expensive, and in general it is a process that's typically hard to do well—especially if you task your developers with creating the training. 

What typically happens is that video training is not created, quality is low, or gets outdated really fast.

That's why a lot of applications struggle with user adoption and growth.

This is a problem of the past for Accenture. They solved this problem. 

How? Using our AI-powered platform!

With Lupo, Accenture developers are able to create video training without the need to record slides, their voice, and no need for video training (unless you want some post-production enhancements).

Accenture developers have now the self-service capabilities that empower them to be more productive, train their end users (which are typically SMEs in this case), and take their knowledge transfer to the next level with Lupo.ai.

If you are an Accenture collaborator who wants to self-service create video training easily, in minutes, and up to 90% cheaper then  just book a meeting with me and I'll get you set up: https://calendly.com/lupoai/xavier/

Lupo has been approved for use internally at Accenture.
