# How Bad Do You Want It? Health and Business Success Version

If you know me or you have read some of my older posts, you are aware of the body transformation that I went through between 2023 and 2024.

Just check out the two pictures, which clearly show the change. If you like numbers and stats, I lost about 75 pounds of pure fat without losing any muscle, without fad diets, pills, Ozempic, surgery, or getting a lover (true fact: apparently men lose weight if they get into an affair). 

None of that. I simply learned how to eat well and used the same discipline that I apply to my work, but to my workout routine.

My motto is "the application of knowledge is the best way to solve problems, make decisions, and achieve goals". And that's what I did.

But one very important part of losing so much weight was my training. The graph in this picture shows how many calories I burned per week. Somewhere between 4000 and 6000 was my average, which meant that I had to work out several times a week. 

I also had to keep my calories in check, to make sure that I did not erase my gains with emotional eating, binging, or drinking.

But that's the meat and potatoes of another post, because today all I want to say is to ask you "how bad do you want it?".

Because whatever your goal is, it is not easy. You have to work towards it. You have to work hard. 

This is what I did to achieve my weight loss goal which is exactly the same thing I do in my business goals.

So, if you want something, go and get it. Make an effort. Keep pressing forward. Your goal is within your reach if you work hard enough and smart enough.

Enjoy the ride!
