# How Does Artificial Intelligence Work?

AI is revolutionizing the way we work, plan our trips, think, and in general it is a huge influence in every field that you can think of.

There are several analogies that I like to use to explain what AI is, here is one that may be easy to understand.

Think of AI as a chef who has to make a new dish.

The chef has a recipe book, which is like the algorithms in an AI system. 

The recipe book tells the chef what ingredients to use and how to combine them to make the dish. 

But, instead of a recipe book, an AI system has access to vast amounts of data. 

This data is like the ingredients the chef uses to make the dish. 

The AI system uses algorithms to analyze the data and make decisions, just like the chef uses the recipe book to make the dish. 

However, unlike a recipe book, the AI system can also learn and improve over time. The more data it processes, the more it can learn and make better decisions. 

So, if the chef keeps trying different recipes and adjusting the ingredients, he can eventually create a new and improved dish. 

In the same way, an AI system can continuously improve its performance by processing more data and learning from its mistakes. 

This is why AI systems can become very good at performing certain tasks, like recognizing faces in images or translating spoken words into text.

What do you think? Clear enough?
