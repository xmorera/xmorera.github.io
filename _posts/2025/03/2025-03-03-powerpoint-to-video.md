# Why Converting PowerPoint to Video Training is the Way To Go (with Lupo)

![PowerPoint to Video](C:\github\xmorera\xmorera.github.io\images\2025)

PowerPoint has been the go-to tool for business presentations for decades. I've personally been creating PowerPoint presentation for pretty much most of my adult life.

With over 30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day worldwide, it's safe to say that most companies already have a vast library of training materials sitting in their archives. 

We used to live in a world of instructor-led training, but because of multiple reasons—and a little push from a global pandemic—video is the new king in town of knowledge delivery.

That's what we have been observing for years, which is the reason why we implemented a functionality for creating video training directly from PowerPoint presentations. 

With this feature, you can create videos in minutes. If you want to try it, simply create an account in Lupo and navigate to https://lupo.ai/Projects/Slides

We've even built a feature for creating the narrations auto-magically with AI. Go ahead and try or if you want to meet with me and learn more, feel free to schedule a FREE call: https://calendly.com/lupoai/xavier

If you are still not convinced on using PowerPoint, read this:

Why Convert PowerPoints to Video?
✅ Leverage Existing Content – Your company has already spent time and resources creating PowerPoint training materials. Instead of starting from scratch, why not convert them into compelling videos that can be watched anytime, anywhere?

✅ Make Training More Accessible – Not everyone learns best from reading slides. Video-based training enhances retention, engagement, and accessibility—especially for remote teams or global audiences.

✅ Remove Technical Barriers – Anyone can make a PowerPoint, but not everyone knows how to edit videos. AI-powered solutions like Lupo.ai take the hassle out of video production, automatically transforming PPTs into high-quality training videos—no video editing skills required.

✅ Scalability & Consistency – Video training ensures that every employee, partner, or customer receives the same high-quality training experience, rather than relying on individual trainers or inconsistent delivery.

✅ Saves Time & Money – Traditional video production is costly and requires specialized teams. With AI, you can turn a PowerPoint into a video in minutes, reducing both costs and production time by up to 80%.
 
If your company has a mountain of PowerPoint presentations, it’s time to turn them into engaging, scalable video content. Let’s stop treating PowerPoint as a static tool and start leveraging it as a powerful engine for automated, effective training.
