# Levels of Artificial Intelligence

There are several different ways to categorize the levels of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but one commonly used framework is based on the capabilities of the AI system. These levels are:

1. **Reactive Machines:** These are the simplest type of AI systems. They can only react to the current situation, don't have memory, and can't use past experiences to inform current decision-making. An example of this type of AI is IBM's Deep Blue, the chess-playing computer that defeated the world champion in 1997.

2. **Limited Memory:** This type of AI system have memory, it can store and recall past experiences to inform current decision-making, but it can't use that information to form an understanding of the world. An example of this type of AI is self-driving cars that use cameras and sensors to detect their surroundings and make decisions based on that information.

3. **Theory of Mind:** This type of AI system can reason. They also understand emotions, beliefs, and intentions. But this type of AI technology is still in the research stage and isn't practical yet.

4. **Self-Aware:** This is the most advanced type of AI. It can be self-aware and understand its consciousness. This is still a topic of debate and research in the field, and it's still being determined if this level will ever be reached.
