# OpenAI: Prompt Engineering (The Best Skill You Can Have)
"AI is not going to replace you, but someone using AI will".

There, I said it. Someone had to say it. That's why you need to become a master at prompt engineering and it is exactly why I built a course that shows you the best features that ChatGPT has available for you. 

If you have a Pluralsight subscription, watch the course here: https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/openai-prompt-engineering

If you are still not convinced, read this:

Prompt engineering with OpenAI is one of the best skills you can have because AI is revolutionizing how we work—automating tasks, generating content, analyzing data, and solving complex problems at scale. Knowing how to craft effective prompts unlocks AI’s full potential, letting you harness its power to boost productivity, creativity, and decision-making in any field.

And if you have questions, let me know! I love to talk about AI.
