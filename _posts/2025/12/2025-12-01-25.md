25!
25 courses in the AI space.
When people ask me what kind of courses I’ve done for Pluralsight, I usually answer: “Oh, just development stuff.”
But that’s not quite the reality.
Somewhere along the way, “just development” turned into a deep dive into AI and then into generative AI. I even believe I was the first person to pitch a generative AI course at Pluralsight. At the time, it felt experimental. Now, it feels obvious that this is where so much of our industry is headed.
Why am I so focused on AI?
Because AI is no longer a niche skill. It is:
- A new layer of abstraction for developers.
- A productivity multiplier for teams.
- A competitive advantage for companies that learn how to use it well.
If you do not understand AI, you are increasingly limited in what you can build, automate, or scale. If you do understand it, you unlock leverage: faster experiments, smarter products, and better ways to share knowledge.
That is why I have gone all in on learning, teaching, and building around AI and generative AI.
Here are the topics I cover across my 25 AI-related courses:
Core Generative AI Foundations
- Core Concepts of Generative AI for Developers
