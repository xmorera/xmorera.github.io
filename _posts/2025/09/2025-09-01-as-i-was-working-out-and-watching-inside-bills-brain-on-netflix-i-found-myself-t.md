# As I Was Working Out and Watching Inside Bill’s Brain on Netflix, I Found Myself Thinking About What Comes After Health

As I was working out and watching Inside Bill’s Brain on Netflix, I found myself thinking about what comes after health.
It may sound obvious, but each of us discovers truths in our own time—and it hit me that the next frontier is economic stability, and with it, opportunity.
The Gates Foundation is doing extraordinary work to help people live longer, healthier lives. But once health is secured, the next challenge is ensuring that people have a path to thrive economically. That’s where one of my favorite phrases comes in: “Talent is distributed equally worldwide, but opportunity is not.”
This is exactly where Lupo.AI could help. Our platform provides a way to create multilingual training videos with minimal requirements, making it possible for underrepresented communities to share what they know and for aid organizations to deliver practical skills training that creates real opportunities.
Getting in touch with the Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates Foundation directly is nearly impossible, and there are no open RFPs in this area right now.
But if you know of NGOs or nonprofits that could use Lupo’s capabilities, I’d love to connect.
We’re part of the Microsoft Startup Accelerator, and I can see the impact of pairing Microsoft’s reach with the Foundation’s legacy—helping people not just survive, but truly flourish.
