# Do You Know How to Go From a Bathroom Stall in the Microsoft Campus to Platinum Status in American Airlines?

Do you know how to go from a bathroom stall in the Microsoft Campus (yeah with a few adult tears) to platinum status in American Airlines, and get to travel the world teaching bleeding edge technology to amazing software developers?
Easy. Stop crying, put your sh#$% together and keep working.
As I told the story in my previous post, I was “set up” by the project manager (MS SME) as he found out the day before the big day of our presentation that things changed internally, so he threw me to the lions with his outdated-like-a-CD-in-a-teens-room content.
Things didn’t go as expected, not my fault. I was just given bad source content which makes the garbage-in garbage-out mantra applies.
Good content is something that’s always key in every training.
But sometimes life gives you a second chance and this is one of those cases.
I was asked to update all the presentations. This required getting the new-and-fresh-from-the-oven SQL Server content and re-delivered it.
Learners liked it. More than that, they found it useful to complete their job and get stuff done.
Microsoft extended the contract with ArtinSoft, and started an engagement called Route 64 where I was able to travel the world to all Microsoft technology centers (MTCs) and teach partners how to adopt 64-bit computing. We were working in conjunction with Intel Corporation and HP.
