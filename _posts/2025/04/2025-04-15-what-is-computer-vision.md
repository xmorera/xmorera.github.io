# What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence and computer science that includes object recognition, image analysis, and scene understanding. In simple words, computer vision is a way for computers to "see" and understand pictures and videos, just like how our eyes see and understand things around us. It helps computers realize what's happening in the pictures and videos and allow them to make decisions based on what they see! Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence and computer science that includes object recognition, image analysis, scene understanding, and more.

Computer vision is used in self-driving cars to understand and avoid obstacles on the road. It is also used in video games to make the characters move and interact with their environment as a real person would.

The process of computer vision is like solving a puzzle. The computer takes a picture or a video and then breaks it down into tiny pieces, just like how we might divide a puzzle into smaller pieces to make it easier to solve. Next, the computer looks at the tiny pieces and tries to figure out what they are and how they fit together, similar to how we look at puzzle pieces and try to figure out what the final picture is. Finally, the computer makes a decision based on what it sees, like a robot moving in a specific direction based on visual cues it receives.

Every computer vision process usually involves the following steps:

1. Acquire an image or video (also known as the "input").
Pre-process the input, which may include tasks such as noise reduction, image enhancement, and color space conversion.

2. Extract features from the pre-processed input, including edges, corners, and other elements used to distinguish one object from another.

3. Analyze the features to make a decision or a prediction based on the content of the input. This step may involve training a machine learning model on a dataset of labeled examples.
