# What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. It involves developing algorithms and models that enable computers to process, understand, and generate human language meaningfully. This can include sentiment analysis, machine translation, text classification, and more. NLP uses statistical and machine learning models to analyze and understand the patterns and structures in human languages. These models are trained on large datasets of text, allowing them to make predictions and generate responses based on that data.

NLP models have been exposed to a large amount of text and learned to identify the patterns and relationships between words and phrases. Think about it like a "Rosetta Stone" for computers, allowing them to translate human languages into a form they can understand and work with, just like the Rosetta Stone helped scholars decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.
