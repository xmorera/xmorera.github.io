# Deep Learning in real life

Deep Learning is being widely used today, and it is one of the most popular fields of Artificial Intelligence since it can solve a huge number of complex tasks such as:
* Computer Vision: images can train the machine to recognize features, and now the machines are demonstrating "superhuman" accuracy for image recognition. Some examples include image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
* Natural Language Processing: neural networks, especially recurrent ones, have allowed enormous advances in language-related issues. Some examples include text prediction, sentiment analysis, information extraction, translation, text-to-speech, and Question Answering.
* Time Series Analysis: networks with temporary data retention capacity allow predictions and forecasting on financial data, weather, or product prices.
* Content Generation: neural networks are the only ones capable of generating content with acceptable quality to the point that some GANs can even fool humans.
* Recommender Systems: Deep Learning can analyze large amounts of user data and make personalized recommendations, such as suggesting movies or products that a user may be interested in.
