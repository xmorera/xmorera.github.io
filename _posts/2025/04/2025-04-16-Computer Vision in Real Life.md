# Computer Vision in Real Life

1. Self-driving cars: Computer vision can be used in autonomous vehicles, allowing them to see and avoid obstacles on the road, like pedestrians, other vehicles, and even animals. It also helps the car to recognize traffic lights and road signs to know when to stop or go. Imagine that the car is like a driver, but instead of eyes, it uses cameras and sensors to see, and it's a computer program that processes the information to make the right decisions.

2. Robotics: Computer vision can be used in robots to navigate and avoid obstacles in their environment, such as walls and furniture. It helps robots recognize and interact with objects, such as picking up, manipulating, or identifying a specific object by its shape, color, or texture. So typically includes object recognition and visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping).

3. Surveillance systems: Computer vision enables surveillance systems to detect and track people and objects without human intervention automatically, including object detection, face recognition, and behavior analysis.

4. Medical imaging: Computer vision assists doctors in diagnosing and treating illnesses, using techniques like image segmentation, registration, and image analysis.

5. Augmented reality: Computer vision enables augmented reality systems to understand and interact with the real world. Thanks to object recognition, marker tracking, and scene understanding.

6. Face recognition: Computer vision-based face recognition systems are used in many security systems for identification and authorization in various devices and applications like mobile, laptops, online services, etc.

7. Industrial Inspection: Computer vision is used in many manufacturing and assembly lines to perform inspections of products and components, such as quality control, detecting defects, or measuring dimensions.

8. Agriculture: Computer vision is used in precision agriculture to improve crop yields with tasks such as plant counting, disease detection, and crop monitoring.
