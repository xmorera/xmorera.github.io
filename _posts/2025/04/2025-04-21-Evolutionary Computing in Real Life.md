# Evolutionary Computing in Real Life

Evolutionary algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by the principles of biological evolution and are widely used in various real-life applications, including:

1. Engineering design optimization: Evolutionary algorithms can optimize the design of various engineering systems, such as airplanes, automobiles, and spacecraft.

2. Finance: Evolutionary algorithms are used in portfolio optimization, algorithmic trading, and risk management.

3. Healthcare: Evolutionary algorithms are used in drug discovery, protein folding prediction, and medical diagnosis.

4. Image and signal processing: Evolutionary algorithms are used for image and signal processing tasks such as image denoising, feature extraction, and compression.

5. Machine learning: Evolutionary algorithms are used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection in machine learning models.

6. Robotics: Evolutionary algorithms are used for robot control and locomotion optimization. These are just a few examples of evolutionary algorithms' many real-life applications.
