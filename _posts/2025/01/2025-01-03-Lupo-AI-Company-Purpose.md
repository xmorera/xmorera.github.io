# Company Purpose: Lupo.ai for the Sequoia Capital Business Plan Guideline


"Lupo.ai’s purpose is to democratize knowledge transfer through AI-driven video training, making it standardized, collaborative, and accessible to everyone."

🟢 Sequoia Capital (the ones behind AirBnb) has a business plan guideline, and this post is part of a series where I expand on each area they suggest. Today I am writing on "Company purpose", which they state the following: "Company purpose: define your company in a single declarative sentence. This is harder than it looks. It’s easy to get caught up listing features instead of communicating your mission."

I would love to say that when I set out to create Lupo.ai, the mission was clear: to make knowledge accessible, transferable, and impactful for everyone.

But that is not true. I did not have an apple fall on my lap or a genie showed me the future. Instead, the start of Lupo has a much more humble and almost "accidental" origin. 🌟

I am a firm believer that if you automate parts of your job, you can go and create even better things because you get the repetitive things out of the way. 

🔷 So a few years ago, when I was creating video training for Pluralsight I started creating tools to automate individual tasks.

Some of these tools included scripts to remove notes from PowerPoint, then a "time-estimator" for helping me create time-bound videos, a markdown to PowerPoint tool to help me create the slides faster, and many more like this. ⏰

The thing is that we reached a point where a large part of the process was automated. That's when I gathered together a team of three developers and we worked on creating a platform for video training generation.

We saw it as a CPS, or Content Production System. Once we got all the tools integrated then it was clear that our purpose is simple yet powerful: "to democratize knowledge transfer through AI-driven video training."

🚀 By leveraging AI, we’ve built a platform that allows businesses to create standardized, collaborative, and self-service video training content, all while reducing the cost and complexity typically associated with such efforts. 

But beyond the tech, our purpose is about people. 👨

Because Lupo is so easy to use, we are in fact leveling the playing field, allowing anyone with specialized knowledge to share it with the world. 

🧑‍🏫 We believe that education isn’t just an investment in productivity or revenue—it’s an investment in human potential. Every course created on Lupo.ai is an opportunity to help someone grow, solve problems, and reach their goals. That’s why we do what we do.

So, what drives us? It's the belief that when knowledge is easy to create, access, and share, everyone wins.

This is the purpose behind Lupo.ai. It’s why we’re here. 👌
