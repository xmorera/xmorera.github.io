#  Lupo.ai – Our Business Model

The business model of a startup is something that is usually closely guarded as it may be its secret weapon.

But not us. We are building in public and we want to be upfront in all aspects around our mission to make education accessible for everyone. 

Here's our approach. At Lupo.ai, our business model is designed to be scalable, flexible, and aligned with the needs and more importantly the budget of our customers—be it that our customer is already a well versed in creating training or on the other hand, they need hand-holding. 

Here’s how we structure our approach to generate value for businesses while driving sustainable growth:

Lupo.ai Subscription-Based
If you have a strong hold on your video production process, you can definitely benefit from the functionality that our platform has to offer. You can subscribe and start creating video training at the push of a button. A basic subscription costs only $99 and comes with 6 hours of produced video content with standard voices. We have a few premium voices available, in case you want to try those too.

How it Works: Businesses subscribe to our platform through tiered pricing plans based on usage, features, and team size.
Benefits for Customers: Predictable costs, scalable access, and no large upfront investments.

Lupo.ai as an Agency
Lupo.ai was born from the experience gathered by its founder (that would be me!) and his team creating courses for companies of all sizes but primarily Pluralsight. 

Lupo began as a collection of "one-off" tools that eventually just made sense to integrate and offer as an SaaS platform.

Thus, if a company requires help developing video training materials in the form of customer education programs, employee training, onboarding materials, compliance training or similar, you can hire us to develop the content that you need. 

How it Works: Users can pay for individual video projects or additional features beyond their subscription plan .
Who It’s For: Businesses with occasional training needs or those testing the platform before committing to a subscription.
 
Regardless of which option you chose, we are well suited for different types of customers: 
- Small teams and limited video production needs.
- For growing organizations with multilingual and collaborative training requirements.
- Large-scale training initiatives with advanced customization and integrations.

We also integrate with Microsoft Azure Marketplace, so you can hire us through Microsoft which is a great added value for our customers.

At every level we offer cost-effective, easy-to-use training solutions to upskill employees or educate customers. We can help you, especially if you are focused on scaling training globally while maintaining quality and consistency.
  
Our AI-driven platform automates much of the video creation process, keeping operational costs low.
