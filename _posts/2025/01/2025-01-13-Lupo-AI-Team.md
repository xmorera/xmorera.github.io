#  Lupo.ai – The Team Behind the Vision

At the heart of every great company is a passionate and skilled team, and Lupo.ai is no exception. Our team is the driving force behind our mission to make education accessible to everyone (or you can also say "democratize knowledge transfer through AI-driven video training", but that's a little bit too long IMHO).

And as always, there is a funny story that I want to share!

I've been in the learning and development space for more than 20 years. When I got started, one of my first topics was teaching people about this NEW THING called the .NET Framework! 

Yes, that's how old I am. 

At first, we hosted trainings in Microsoft's Seattle Campus, at Building 20—this is where I met the Pluralsight people when they were doing in person training!

Later on, we traveled the world to every possible Microsoft Technology Center (MTC) to teach partners about adopting 64-bit computing.

Fast-forward a "few" years and I am hard at work creating courses for Pluralsight. Sidenote: If you want to learn about Gen AI and other related topics, feel free to visit my Pluralsight author profile page: https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/xavier-morera

Anyway, to speed up video production for my courses, I started developing tools to automate bits and pieces of the process... first by myself and they I started to add developers and our video editor to help make video production easier, one tool at a time.

And then it happened. We were so close to automating the whole process that creating a "take your content over here, push a button, and get a video" came out pretty naturally.

And that's how Lupo was born, from a team that was already hard at work creating courses. We just automated what we were doing on a daily basis. 

What Sets Us Apart
The Lupo.ai team isn’t just technically skilled—we just took the problem that we were solving manually, automated it, and released it to the world. 

Now you can create your own video courses with Lupo.

And we love what we do. Together, we’re more than a team—we’re partners in transforming the future of learning and making education accessible for everyone.
