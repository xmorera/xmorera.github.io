# Lupo.ai According to Sequioa Capital's Business Plan Guide

There is a saying that goes "when all you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail".

Well, in my case I got plenty of more tools, however my big passion is training. It is my hammer.

Why not? I get to learn cutting-edge and useful tech things which I can apply and then teach to others, helping them improve their lives one tech training at a time.

That's in a nutshell why I founded Lupo.ai, an AI-driven platform for creating video training in a standardized, collaborative, self-service, and cost-efficient way.

Effectively we democratize knowledge transfer through video, by removing technical and linguistic barriers.

And recently I came across Sequioa Capital's guide to writing a business plan: https://articles.sequoiacap.com/writing-a-business-plan

I will spend the next few days dedicating a single post to each one of their points:

- Company purpose 
- Problem  
- Solution  
- Why now?  
- Market potential 
- Competition / alternatives  
- Business model 
- Team  
- Financials  
- Vision  

I invite you to read them and DM me if you want to talk, I am always open for a conversation.
