# Lupo.ai According to Sequioa Capital's Business Plan Guide

There is a saying that goes "when all you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail".

Well, in my case I got plenty of more tools, however my big passion is training. It is my hammer.

That's why I think training is one of the best investments companies can make. 

Oh but don't just take my word. Many companies have discovered that by deploying customer education programs and employee training they can increase their revenue and lower their costs.

Money aside, the point is that I love being in the learning and development space. 

Why not? Whenever I learn new things in my projects as a software developer... some of them even cutting-edge, I can then teach my new found knowledge to others, helping them improve their lives one tech training at a time.

That's in a nutshell, why I founded Lupo.ai, an AI-driven platform for creating video training in a standardized, collaborative, self-service, and cost-efficient way.

Effectively, our platform democratizes knowledge transfer through video, by removing technical and linguistic barriers.

Recently I came across Sequioa Capital's guide to writing a business plan: https://articles.sequoiacap.com/writing-a-business-plan, thus I will spend the next few days dedicating a single post to each one of their points:

- Company purpose 
- Problem  
- Solution  
- Why now?  
- Market potential 
- Competition / alternatives  
- Business model 
- Team  
- Financials  
- Vision  

I invite you to read them and DM me if you want to talk, I am always open for a conversation which may help you learn new things or perhaps increase your companies revenue / decrease costs.
