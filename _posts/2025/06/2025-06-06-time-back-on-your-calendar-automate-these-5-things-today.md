# Time Back on Your Calendar: Automate These 5 Things Today

![Placeholder image](/images/2025/time-back-on-your-calendar-automate-these-5-things-today.jpg)

Running a startup while funding it and trying to get it to grow is way worse that fixing a plane while flying it. 

If your day disappears before youâ€™ve even hit your stride, itâ€™s time to delegateâ€”*not to people, but to automation.*

Here are 5 simple but powerful automations that I use to reclaim hours each week so that I can keep my mental sanity:

ðŸ§¾ **Invoicing & Payment Reminders**
Set it and forget it. Get paid on time, no more chasing clients. I use Paypal, Stripe, and Mercury.

ðŸ“… **Meeting Scheduling**
Ditch email ping-pong. I use Calendly to handle this instantly. Let people decide when they want to meet, based on  your calendar.

ðŸ’¬ **Meeting Summaries**
Besides all the things I need to manage, I am also a middle age guy with too many balls in the air. I use Fathom to get clear actionable items after each meeting.

ðŸ“ˆ **Progress Reports & Dashboards**
I use a Kanban board to keep track of everything that I need to work on and its status. I auto-generate weekly snapshots to keep everyone in the loopâ€”without manual effort. This puts the direction where we are going in autopilot, allowing us to grow.

ðŸ‘‹ **Employee Onboarding**
Templates, videos, and scheduled welcome emails = scalable, smooth onboarding. We use Lupo to build our own videos. Can't make it easier than this.

Start with just one of these and give your future self a gift: more time to focus on what truly matters.
