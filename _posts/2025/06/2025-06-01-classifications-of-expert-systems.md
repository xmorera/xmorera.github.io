# Classifications of Expert Systems

![ALT](/images/2025/06/classifications-of-expert-systems.jpg)

Expert systems can be classified based on their domain of expertise, the way they represent knowledge, and the inference engine they use.
Based on the way they represent knowledge, expert systems can be classified into:
📖 Rule-based expert systems: use a set of rules to represent knowledge.
📖 Frame-based expert systems: use a set of frames or objects to represent knowledge.
📖 Case-based expert systems: use a set of cases or examples to represent knowledge.
Based on the type of inference engine, expert systems can be classified into:
📝 Forward-chaining expert systems: These systems start from a given set of facts and use rules to make inferences.
📝 Backward-chaining expert systems: These systems start from a desired conclusion and work backward to find the necessary facts.
