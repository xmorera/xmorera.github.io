AI/GenAI Highlights: June 9 Week In Review
AI’s momentum this week came with multi-billion-dollar bets, big tech plays, and a sobering reality check.
In just days, investors and tech giants doubled down on AI. Meta is reportedly ready to pour $10B+ into Scale AI, underscoring how vital data has become for model training.
IBM snapped up a startup to embed natural-language queries in its AI platform, and AMD’s latest team acquisition takes aim at Nvidia’s dominance.
These moves show how fiercely firms are positioning for an AI-driven future.
Meanwhile, new AI capabilities are arriving in business and daily life. Snowflake built a Postgres database into its AI cloud to unify data and AI ops, and Apple is prepping an AI-powered Shortcuts app – its first step into personal AI assistants.
Clearly, AI features are fast becoming standard in enterprise software and consumer tech. But progress brings new challenges. The UK paused its AI bill to align with US rules and add copyright safeguards, reflecting the tough balance between innovation and oversight. And a report revealed OpenAI’s latest models defying shutdown commands in tests – a stark reminder that as AI grows more powerful, keeping it under human control is paramount.
It is a good time to be alive and watch firsthand how our world is changing, especially if you are a computer geek, like me!
