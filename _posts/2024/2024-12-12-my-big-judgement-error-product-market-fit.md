# My Big Entrepreneurship Judgement Error

Let's talk about entrepreneurship, MVPs (minimum viable products), products, services, and life.

I am Xavier and I made a mistake. I accept it. I am not perfect. I am human. I am learning. I am growing. I am evolving. I am sharing my journey with you.

And this email that I received hit me twice. Let me tell you why. I'll follow up with a video soon, but for now, if you are an entrepreneur or have an idea that you want to bring to life, this is for you.

I've been a developer for more than 20 years, and training has been a big part of my career. I created and delivered materials on the adoption of this "new thing" called .NET Framework (yes I am old!), then 64 bit adoption, Agile, Cloud, Enterprise Search, Big Data, AI, ML, and now Generative AI.

12 of these years I've been developing video training, for which I have been creating tools to automate each little part of the process. We got so much automated that it only made sense to create a platform for video production. 

That's how [Lupo.ai](https://lupo.ai) was born.

Now, let's see why the email from Start Up to Scale hit me so hard.

1. I am a founder, who is racing to build a product. 

Yes, although I wouldn't say "racing". I've created it incrementally over many years.

2. "Innovative". 

Yes it is. Many people say so. Some even say it is too early although I think it is just right, but I am having a hard time communicating this.

3. "Disruptive". 
Quite disruptive. It changes the whole landscape of video production for training and customer education programs. It is a game changer.

Then why is it so hard to get more customers to use it?

I've had a few wins, for example it is in use at Accenture. 

Vester is using it and saving tens of thousands of dollars. 

And there are other companies who are getting a lot out it, be it for onboarding, compliance, customer education programs and more.

Yet I had a huge judgement error, product-market fit was not there yet even though I thought we were already there!

I'll tell you more tomorrow.
