Looking back, 2024 has been nothing short of transformative. It’s been a year filled with my biggest challenges, a complete overhaul of mind and body, moments of pure joy, and times of deep struggle. From navigating the rollercoaster of launching a startup to building Generative AI courses for Pluralsight—all while managing our support center and a few other endeavors—this year has tested me like never before.

For months, my thoughts have been consumed by the future I’m working tirelessly to create. Every decision has felt like a balancing act: minimizing risks while embracing the possibility of failure, striving to make the best choices at each step. As the holidays approach and the year draws to a close, it’s the perfect moment to reflect—not just on what 2024 taught us, but on what we need to change for 2025.

We only live once, so let’s make it count. Don’t get stuck repeating the same year over and over. Take charge, design your future, and remember that your success lies in your hands. Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and a 2025 filled with growth, joy, and endless possibilities!
