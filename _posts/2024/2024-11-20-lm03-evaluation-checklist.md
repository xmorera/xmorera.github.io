# Self Evaluation Checklist

In yesterday's post, (The Impact of Training Programs)[], I explained why training is essential for thriving in the new era. 

Today, I want to share a self-evaluation checklist to help you assess whether you need or don't need to create your very own video training programs.

Take a look at the checklist in the image.

Now, go ahead and answer the questions, which I also include below.  

- Are your company's sales not growing?  
- Are your customers not renewing contracts?  
- Are new technologies introduced often, leaving you with technical debt or lack of innovation?  
- Are you having low conversion rates?  
- Are your current customers opening support tickets too frequently?  
- Are you identifying skill gaps in your workforce?  
- Are your employees showing decreased productivity, low morale, or leaving?  
- Are you running into compliance issues?  
- Are your employees making frequent mistakes?  

If you answered “yes” to one or more of these questions, your organization may benefit significantly from a targeted video training strategy. 

I'll leave it here for today, so that you can think a bit more and reflect on the current status of your company. 

Tomorrow I'll expand on why video training can help you solve these problems.
