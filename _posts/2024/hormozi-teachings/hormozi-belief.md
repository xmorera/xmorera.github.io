My favorite quote of all time: “We question all of our beliefs except for those we truly believe. Those, we never think to question.”

 

Mozi Money Minute: Belief Breaking Formula

People talk about breaking the beliefs of your prospect all the time. But no one talks about how to do it. This is the four step framework I use. Worth teaching your sales team when you need to confront a prospect with poor beliefs.

Say their wrong belief from the first person (so it’s not offensive): “I used to think that getting lawncare services was a luxury only the rich could afford.”
Say why it’s wrong: “It takes me half a day to do it myself, then I'm exhausted.”
Say what’s right: “Then I realized if I make more than a lawncare worker, then it’s actually cheaper for me to let someone else do it, and work my main job in the meantime.”
Proof: “John went from dreading his Sundays (when he used to take care of the yard) to working for a couple hours then spending the rest of the time with his family. He no longer keeps up with the Joneses. He IS the Joneses.”
If selling 1 on 1 - Repeat with an avatar as similar to the person you’re talking to as possible. 

If selling 1 to many - add different avatars to represent each avatar you sell to. 

 

That is all. As promised, under a minute.
