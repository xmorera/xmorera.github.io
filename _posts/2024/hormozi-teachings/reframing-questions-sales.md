# Sales Skill: Reframing Questions to Close More Deals

Main points from the transcript:

1. **Sales Skill: Reframing** – The speaker introduces reframing as a powerful sales technique that helps turn objections into opportunities to close a sale. Reframing involves asking questions about a prospect's question instead of directly answering it to maintain control of the conversation.

2. **3A Framework for Reframing**:
   - **Acknowledge**: Restate what the prospect says to build rapport and buy time to think.
   - **Associate**: Link the prospect’s question or concern to behaviors or questions of successful customers.
   - **Ask**: After reframing the objection, ask the next question that moves the sale forward.

3. **Five Rules for Using Reframing Ethically**:
   - **Rule 1**: A prospect believes more in what they say than what you say, so guide them to make their own positive conclusions.
   - **Rule 2**: Don’t disagree with the prospect; instead, ask more questions to keep control.
   - **Rule 3**: Tell them what their question means, using associations to make them feel their concerns are valid.
   - **Rule 4**: Use straw men (examples of other people or past customers) to introduce tough truths without offending the prospect.
   - **Rule 5**: Retain childlike curiosity by asking questions with genuine interest to keep the conversation moving forward and avoid confrontation.

4. **Key Sales Tactics**:
   - Ask for the sale multiple times without harming rapport.
   - The person asking the questions controls the conversation.
   - Use acknowledgment and association to buy time and turn objections into affirmations.
   - Maintain control by not directly answering every objection but reframing and asking additional questions.

5. **Importance of Ethical Sales**:
   - The technique should help prospects make good decisions, not manipulate them.
   - Ethical sales involve stating facts, telling the truth, and ensuring the product or service is a good fit for the customer.

6. **Practical Application**:
   - The reframing technique can be used in various sales contexts, from $100 products to million-dollar service packages.
   - Beginner salespeople often struggle with objections; this method helps them handle tough questions without sounding defensive or combative.

7. **Closing Insight**:
   - The best closers ask the most times and maintain rapport throughout.
   - The goal is to make the prospect feel right, not to win arguments.

The video ends with a call to action for more advanced sales training through the speaker's company.
