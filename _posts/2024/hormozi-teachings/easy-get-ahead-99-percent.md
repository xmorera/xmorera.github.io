# How to Get Ahead of 99% of People (Homrmozi's Teachings)
I have a problem, that I was finally able to comprehend in a way that I wish  I had 20 years ago.

Let me explain.

I work hard. I work a lot. I get the results that are expected of me and beyond for my customers. 

But there are times that I don't do the same for my **personal** projects.

I was finally able to realize _why_ with this video from Alex Hormozi, watch it if you want to hear his words of wisdom. Or if you are short on time, here's what you need to know:

**TL;DR; Focus on identifying the most impactful problem in your business by prioritizing it above all else, eliminate all distractions, align all resources, and work on this problem fiercely until it gets completed. No excuses, no multi-tasking, no nothing else. Don't stop until it gets done.**

## The Secret to Business Growth: Focus on the A+ Problems  

Most people work hard but fail to make meaningful progress. Why? Because they spend their time solving **B+ problems**—tasks that feel productive but don't meaningfully move the needle. If you're serious about scaling your business, the key lies in pruning distractions and focusing on the **A+ problems**—those big, hairy challenges that will significantly impact your growth.  

In this blog post, I'll share how to identify and tackle the one thing that matters most in your business, based on strategies I’ve used to scale my portfolio of companies generating over $250M annually.

### **1. Stop Watering the Offshoots**
Think of your business as a tree. Every task you work on is like an offshoot branch. When you spread your resources across too many offshoots—adding features, tweaking email sequences, fixing minor bugs—your business doesn't grow taller. Instead, the energy that could fuel the trunk of your tree (your core growth driver) gets diverted.  

To grow your "tree" (revenue), you must cut off those offshoots and focus all your resources on strengthening the trunk. This means eliminating distractions and channeling your energy into the one initiative that will have the highest impact.

### **2. The Trap of the B+ Problem**
Most of us gravitate toward tasks we can solve quickly—what I call "B+ problems." These are tasks that feel good to check off a list but don’t lead to significant progress.  

The **A+ problem**, on the other hand, is complex. It's unknown, messy, and often overwhelming. It might require multiple iterations, systems analysis, or hard decisions. However, solving it often makes the B+ problems irrelevant.  

**For example:**  
If you're running ads, your A+ problem might be fixing pixel tracking. Without accurate tracking, optimizing funnels, pages, or follow-ups is pointless. Yet, many teams focus on the latter because it’s easier. Fix the pixel, and everything downstream improves.

### **3. The Theory of Constraints**
Every business has one key constraint that limits growth. Identify and address this constraint, and your business can scale. However, it requires ruthless prioritization.  

**How to Apply This:**  
- List all your problems and opportunities.  
- Identify the one that will most significantly impact growth.  
- Focus all resources on solving that problem.  
- Reassess after completing it to determine the next priority.  

By addressing the primary constraint, you often find that other problems either resolve themselves or become irrelevant.

### **4. Prune, Commit, and Execute**
Commitment is about eliminating alternatives. To solve your A+ problem, you must stop working on everything else.  

Here’s how:  
1. **Set Clear Priorities:** Identify the one thing that matters most.  
2. **Create Urgency:** Schedule frequent check-ins (e.g., daily instead of weekly).  
3. **Eliminate Distractions:** Tell your team to let minor fires burn. For example, if someone complains about slower turnaround times, it's okay—as long as you're focused on solving the core issue.  
4. **Communicate Clearly:** Ensure everyone understands the priority and knows their role. Ask team members to repeat back their assignments to avoid confusion.

**Example:**  
I once worked with a team struggling with poor event attendance. By aligning the entire company on improving the show-up rate, we achieved a 35% revenue increase in 30 days. Other minor issues were deprioritized because they didn’t contribute to the immediate goal.

### **5. Stop Building Half-Finished Bridges**
One of the biggest mistakes businesses make is spreading resources across multiple initiatives, never fully completing any. This results in a graveyard of half-built bridges—projects that use resources but fail to deliver results.  

Instead, focus on finishing one bridge at a time. Get it to the other side of the river (a completed project that delivers measurable results) before starting the next.

### **6. Embrace the Unknown**
A+ problems are intimidating because they involve uncertainty. You might not know where to start or how it will end, but progress begins with understanding the problem.  

**How to Start:**  
- Pull the thread: Take one small step toward exploring the issue.  
- Learn as you go: Each step will reveal the next.  
- Don’t expect instant answers: Some problems take days or weeks to solve, but the impact is worth the effort.

---

### **7. Create Feedback Loops**
Fast feedback accelerates progress. Increase the frequency of meetings and communication for high-priority tasks. For example:  
- Move from weekly check-ins to daily (or even twice a day) updates.  
- Ask team members to show their work frequently and provide immediate feedback.  

---

### **8. Make Winning Clear and Rewarding**
Motivate your team by making progress visible and rewarding success:  
- Use dashboards or progress markers to show improvement in real-time.  
- Set rewards for achieving milestones, such as team outings or early finishes.  

---

### **9. Strategy is Prioritization**
Excellent strategists are simply great at prioritizing. They know that the best opportunities often outweigh the "good" ones.  

Ask yourself:  
- Is this task moving me toward my ultimate goal?  
- Will solving this problem make other tasks irrelevant?  

Focus on the big wheel, not the small one. One revolution of the big wheel can accomplish more than ten spins of the small one.

---

### **10. Rinse and Repeat**
Once you’ve solved your A+ problem:  
- Reassess the situation with fresh eyes.  
- Identify the next most important issue.  
- Repeat the process of prioritizing, pruning, and executing.

### **Final Thoughts**
The key to growing your business isn't doing more—it’s doing the right things. Focus relentlessly on the one problem that will drive the most growth, even if it’s messy or uncomfortable. Let the small fires burn, and watch your business grow taller and stronger.  

Remember, success isn’t about how fast you move—it’s about how far you move with every step you take.
