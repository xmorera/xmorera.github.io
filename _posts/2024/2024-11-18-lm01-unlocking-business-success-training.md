# Unlocking Business Success: The Power of Training
Times are tough and if your customers don't know how to use your products or services well, your company is as good as dead. 

Let me tell you why and what you need to do.

We’re living in extraordinary times.

Technology was already advancing rapidly thanks to the "golden trifecta": cheap computing (cloud), the explosion of data, and advanced AI algorithms.

Now, Generative AI has taken it to another level, transforming productivity. What once took days can now be explored, created, and iterated in minutes, unlocking possibilities that were unimaginable a few years ago.

The impact is akin to the rise of search engines—can you imagine life without Google? Soon, Gen AI will be just as integral to work and life.

But remember, with great power comes increased competition. Gen AI levels the playing field, making the business landscape sharper than ever.

Some companies are going to thrive while others are going to struggle. What can you do to be one of those that thrive instead of struggle?

Aside from having a great product and good marketing, there is one piece of the puzzle that many companies forget: training.

If your customers don't know how to use your product, your product is just as good as dead. No adoption means turning off the lights.

For the past couple of months I've been writing about all the things that training can do to improve your company and even for you.

This week I will write a series of posts that tell you more about how to increase your revenue or decrease costs through training. Hope they will be useful to you.
