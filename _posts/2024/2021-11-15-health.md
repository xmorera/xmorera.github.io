Health is the Best Productivity Hack: An Idea Worth Spreading

If you are reading this in Linkedin, chances are that you are a busy knowledge worker, like me.

I won't speak for you, but when I started 22 years ago I started to gain weight... and gain.. and gain... and did I say gain weight like it was falling out of fashion.

Part of it was my ignorance around nutrition but the other part was that we were (traveling the world)[https://xaviermorera.com/posts/2023/10/01/road-warrior.html] teaching Microsoft Partners how adopt 64-bit computing and how to migrate their applications to this new thing called "the .NET Framework".

Before I knew it, my bad habits compounded and I was OBESE, which is not a sin but last year I started to changed my life for good and this is what I can tell you:

HEALTHY AND FIT IS THE BEST PRODUCTIVITY HACK.

In today’s world, productivity hacks are everywhere, from the latest apps and organizational tools to strategies for squeezing the most out of each day. 

But for me, the most transformative "work hack" has been my journey to reclaiming my health. 

Once weighing in at 103 kg, I am now a fit and energetic 70 kg. 

This journey has profoundly impacted not only my health but also my productivity, resilience, and approach to work. 

Here are a few takeaways that I can tell you from my experience:

1. Health Equals Energy, and Energy Fuels Productivity
As I started to lose weight and get fitter, I felt a noticeable increase in energy. This wasn’t just about physical stamina but also mental clarity. 

Healthier habits improved my ability to focus and made my workdays more efficient.  

2. Mental Clarity and Decision-Making
Physical health and mental clarity go hand-in-hand. Exercise, a balanced diet, and good sleep not only helped me lose weight but also sharpened my mental acuity. 

Research supports that regular exercise boosts cognitive function and reduces stress—both critical when making strategic decisions. My healthier lifestyle helped me make smarter, quicker, and more thoughtful decisions at work.

3. Improved Resilience and Stress Management
At my peak weight, stress took a larger toll on my body and mind. But as my fitness improved, so did my resilience. Regular exercise and better sleep taught me how to manage stress more effectively, transforming it into fuel rather than a barrier. 

In high-pressure work environments, this change has been invaluable. Instead of succumbing to stress, I can now harness it to stay focused, stay calm, and adapt quickly.

4. Self-Discipline and Goal Setting
Losing over 75 pounds took dedication, patience, and consistency. These same qualities have translated directly into my work life.  

5. The Power of Routine
A consistent health routine acts as a foundation. When I’m up early, eating nutritious meals, and dedicating time to exercise, I find it easier to get into a productive work rhythm. 

Health routines provide structure that cascades into other areas of life. The consistency I developed with my health goals naturally supports my work, making every day feel more organized and intentional.

6. Long-Term Work Capacity
Prioritizing health isn’t just about short-term productivity. It’s a long-term investment in sustainable career growth. 

Achieving a healthy weight and maintaining it has reduced my risk of many chronic illnesses and health issues, ensuring that I can continue to work and contribute at a high level for years to come.


The journey to health is never just physical; it’s mental, emotional, and even spiritual. Making the commitment to improve my health taught me that the most impactful work hack doesn’t involve a new gadget or technique—it’s about taking care of the one asset we have for life: our bodies. It also demonstrated the power of consistency and discipline.

For anyone striving for success in their career, my advice is simple: prioritize health, because when you’re physically and mentally fit, you’re unstoppable.

It is working for me. 

BTW: My work life revolves around my passion for training and programming. However, this recently discovered second passion for health and fitness is something I am really enjoying. 

I am not trying to inspire anyone, but if you want to have a conversation just hit me up on Linkedin. I have good advice and love to talk about this topic as well.
