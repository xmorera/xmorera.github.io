# The Impact of Training Programs

Yesterday I wrote a post called [Unlocking Business Success: The Power of Training]() telling you why we are living through interesting but tough times, mainly because of the golden trifecta (computing + data + AI) which was augmented by Gen AI.

If you don't want to read my previous post or don't have time to do so, all you need to know is that **training** is one of the keys to thriving in this new era.

Investing in training programs is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. But don't just listen to what I have to say. Look at what companies that know _how things work_ have to say on this matter.

According to a Forrester Consulting report, **90% of companies have seen a positive return on their customer education (training) investments**.

90%!!! I will take my chances with a 90%.

Having said that, some of the benefits that you will get from training are:

- **Increased revenue**: Training will help you customers use your products or services effectively, driving value and increasing purchases.
- **Higher retention rates**: Educated customers are more likely to remain loyal.
- **Improved customer satisfaction**: A clear understanding of products or services leads to happier customers.
- **Decreased support costs**: With proper education, customers and employees can solve problems independently.

## The Business Case for Training Programs

For large organizations, the financial impact of training is immense. It often results in **multi-million-dollar revenue increases** and **millions in cost savings**. The ripple effects of effective training go beyond profit, enhancing company culture, improving collaboration, and fostering long-term relationships with customers and employees.

The numbers don’t lie. Training programs accelerate adoption, improve retention, and drive exponential growth. It’s time to assess your company’s approach to training—whether for customers, employees, or contractors—and unlock your business’s full potential.

## Beyond Customer Education: Employee and Contractor Training

Training isn’t just for customers. Investing in your **employees** and **contractors** can turn them into highly skilled, loyal assets for your company. 

Well-trained team members work more effectively, innovate better, and contribute significantly to overall organizational success.

The question I have for you is: **are you investing in your customers and employees?**

If you are not, then you are definitely leaving money on the table.

Oh and one more thing. **If you are worried that if you train your employees they will leave... just remember that it could be worst. What if you DON'T train them and they stay!"
