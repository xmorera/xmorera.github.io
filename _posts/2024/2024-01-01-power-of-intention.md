The Power of Intention

I came across a wonderful talk recently by Dr. Wayne Dyer called [The Power of Intention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiiVdpimpS0). 

**No matter what stage in life you are, it is worth listening to it**.

In this talk, the Dr. Wayne emphasizes the importance of spiritual growth and inner connection, arguing that our society suffers from a spiritual deficit rather than an information deficit. He presents ten principles for living a fulfilling life, derived from various spiritual and philosophical teachings. 

These principles are designed to foster an open mind, detachment, love, personal responsibility, and a focus on giving rather than receiving. He also highlights the significance of silence, letting go of the past, changing one's mindset, embracing one's divinity, and avoiding weakening thoughts. He uses anecdotes and metaphors to illustrate how these principles can be applied in daily life to achieve peace and success.

**10 Principles**
1. Have a Mind that is Open to Everything and Attached to Nothing: Embrace potentiality and possibility without being easily offended or tied to specific outcomes.
1. You Can't Give Away What You Don't Have: Ensure you possess love, kindness, and peace within before you can give them to others.
1. There Are No Justified Resentments: Let go of resentment as it harms you more than anyone else.
1. Don't Die with Your Music Still in You: Pursue your passions and dreams without fear.
1. Embrace Silence: Use meditation and silence to connect with your source and find peace.
1. Give Up Your Personal History: Release attachment to past wounds and live in the present moment.
1. You Can't Solve a Problem with the Same Mind that Created It: Change your mindset to solve problems effectively.
1. Treat Yourself as if You Already Are What You Would Like to Become: Visualize and act as if you have already achieved your goals.
1. Treasure Your Divinity: Recognize and trust in your inner divine connection.
1. Wisdom is Avoiding All Thoughts Which Weaken You: Focus on empowering thoughts to maintain strength and avoid weakening yourself with negative emotions.
