# How Video Training Can Solve Yesterday's Problems

Yeah, by yesterday I don't mean it in an ethereal way... what I meant is that in yesterday's post, (Self Evaluation Checklist)[], I gave you a list of questions for you to reflect and decide if you wanted to do something to improve your company's bottom line.

If you answered yes to many of the questions, then the good news is that you could solve them with something as "simple" as video training.

## How Video Training Can Solve These Problems
1. Drive Sales Growth
Comprehensive video training equips your sales team with consistent messaging, advanced selling techniques, and insights into your products and services. The result? More confident teams that close deals faster.

2. Improve Customer Retention
Customers renew contracts when they feel valued and informed. Training videos for customers—like onboarding tutorials and product how-tos—can improve satisfaction and loyalty by reducing confusion and empowering users.

3. Adapt to New Technologies and Reduce Technical Debt
Video training helps employees adopt new tools and workflows faster. These sessions can cover the why and how of new technologies, reducing resistance to change and minimizing technical debt.

4. Boost Conversion Rates
Low conversion rates often indicate a knowledge gap in how your teams engage prospects. Customized training videos enable employees to better understand and address customer needs, resulting in higher conversions.

5. Decrease Support Tickets
Video content like FAQs and product troubleshooting guides can help customers solve issues on their own, cutting down on repetitive support tickets and freeing up your support team for more complex problems.

6. Close Workforce Skill Gaps
Training videos allow employees to upskill at their own pace, ensuring your workforce stays competitive and capable, no matter the industry.

7. Enhance Employee Productivity and Retention
When employees have access to clear, engaging training resources, they feel more confident in their roles. Video training improves morale by showing employees you’re invested in their growth, which can also reduce turnover.

8. Stay Compliant
Compliance issues can be costly and damaging. Video training ensures that all employees receive consistent guidance on policies, laws, and regulations, reducing the risk of non-compliance.

9. Reduce Employee Mistakes
Frequent errors often stem from a lack of understanding. Clear, concise training videos are an efficient way to teach processes, reducing mistakes and improving overall efficiency.
