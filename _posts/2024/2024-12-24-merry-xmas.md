# Merry Christmas 2024 and Best Wishes for 2025
I can say without a doubt that 2024 has been by far and away the year I will never forget.

This year I've experienced my biggest challenges, undergone a total mind and body transformation, enjoyed some really happy times but also extremely hard times, as well as the challenge (and pleasure) of trying to get a startup off the ground... all while creating Gen AI courses for Pluralsight and running a few other things like our support center.

My mind has been racing for months, thinking about the future that I am working dilligently on creating, trying to make the right decision at each step, minimizing risk but also without fear of failure.

As we are getting close to the end of the year and the holidays are starting, it is my time to reflect on what do I need to change for 2025 and I invite you to do the same.

After all, we only live once... so we need to make it count.

Don't live the same year over and over again. Create your future and remember that you and only you are responsible for your outcome.

I wish you a Merry Christmas and happy times in 2025!
