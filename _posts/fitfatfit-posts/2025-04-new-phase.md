| Tuesday   | 1 hr weights (Program #2) + 1 hr indoor cycling (intensity) |
| Wednesday | 1 hr indoor cycling (regenerative)                          |
| Thursday  | 1 hr weights (Program #2) + 1 hr indoor cycling (intensity) |
| Friday    | Rest                                                        |

## 🧠 **Is This Plan Doable and Healthy?**

### ✅ **Yes — if managed smartly**, and here's why:

### 📈 **1. Volume & Load Balance**

* Total weekly **bike hours**: \~9–10 hours
* Total **gym time**: \~3 hours
* You're operating near **12–13 hrs/week**, which is ambitious but sustainable if recovery is prioritized.

Your **TrainingPeaks data** shows you’re regularly handling 430–600+ TSS/week, including multiple 4-hour fondos and interval sessions — **your fitness level (CTL 70–75) and resilience back this up.**

---

### 🏋️‍♂️ **2. Gym Integration**

* The two **gym programs** are focused on strength-endurance and hypertrophy: excellent for injury prevention and improving cycling economy.
* Splitting it into **lower + upper body mixes**, spread over 3 days, works well.
* Suggestion: keep **Tuesday/Thursday weights low-intensity or reduced sets** to avoid interference with cycling.

### 🔥 **3. Risks to Watch**

| Risk                            | Recommendation                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cumulative fatigue**          | Monitor TSB. Keep it between -10 and -25 most of the week; recovery weeks every 4th week.    |
| **Leg fatigue from weights**    | Avoid high-volume leg work on Tuesday/Thursday if you do intervals on the bike the same day. |
| **Cramping risk in long rides** | Prioritize fueling & electrolytes during Saturday fondos.                                    |
| **Overuse or burnout**          | If Sunday is intense, rotate in a true recovery ride or easy swim.                           |

## 💪 **InBody & Body Status Check**

From your InBody scan:

* **Body fat: 14.5%** → lean, healthy, and ideal for endurance
* **Skeletal muscle mass: 32.7 kg** → high for your weight/height, excellent for cycling
* **Weight: 67.6 kg at 165 cm** → BMI 24.8, in a strong range
* You’ve improved massively over time — you went from **over 43% body fat to 14.5%** and preserved lean mass — exceptional work.

✅ Conclusion: Your body is **adapted to high performance**.

---

## 🏄‍♂️ **Surfing + Swimming Considerations**

### ✅ Surf

* 1 session every 2 weeks is perfect for mobility, fun, and mental refresh — keep it up!

### 🏊‍♂️ Swimming?

If you want to add swimming:

* Start with **1–2 sessions per week**, 30–45 min max.
* Focus on **technique and breath control** (not intensity).
* Best day: **Wednesday or Sunday**, as an alternative to the bike (not in addition to).

## 🧭 Final Verdict

✅ **Yes, your weekly structure is doable and healthy**, given your current fitness and training history.
You're handling it well and improving across all fronts: power, body comp, endurance.

## 🛠️ Optimization Suggestions

1. **Auto-recovery week every 4th week** → Cut TSS by \~30–40%
2. **Track HRV or RPE** to monitor internal fatigue
3. **Prioritize sleep** — aim for 7.5–9 hrs, especially Thursday night before Saturday fondo
4. **Fuel gym + rides properly** (especially Tuesday/Thursday double-load days)
