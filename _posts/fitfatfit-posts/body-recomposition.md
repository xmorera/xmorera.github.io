Your calorie intake during a body recomposition phase will depend on whether your goal is to prioritize fat loss, muscle gain, or maintain your weight while improving body composition. Here’s how you can estimate your recommended calorie intake based on your profile and activity level:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**
Your **BMR** is the number of calories your body needs to perform basic functions at rest. Using the **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation**:
\[
\text{BMR} = 10 \times \text{weight (kg)} + 6.25 \times \text{height (cm)} - 5 \times \text{age (years)} + 5
\]

\[
\text{BMR} = 10 \times 70 + 6.25 \times 166 - 5 \times 46 + 5
\]
\[
\text{BMR} = 700 + 1037.5 - 230 + 5 = 1512.5 \, \text{calories/day}
\]

---

### **Step 2: Adjust for Activity Level**
To account for your daily activity, multiply your BMR by an activity factor:
- **Sedentary:** \( \text{BMR} \times 1.2 \)
- **Lightly Active (e.g., 1-3 days of exercise/week):** \( \text{BMR} \times 1.375 \)
- **Moderately Active (e.g., 3-5 days of exercise/week):** \( \text{BMR} \times 1.55 \)
- **Very Active (e.g., 6-7 days of exercise/week):** \( \text{BMR} \times 1.725 \)

Assuming you are **moderately active** with 300–600 calories burned daily:
\[
\text{TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)} = 1512.5 \times 1.55 = 2344 \, \text{calories/day}
\]

---

### **Step 3: Adjust for Recomposition Goals**
- **Fat Loss (Moderate Deficit):** Aim for 10–20% below TDEE.
  \[
  \text{Calories for Fat Loss} = 2344 \times 0.8 \, \text{to} \, 0.9 \approx 1875 \, \text{to} \, 2110 \, \text{calories/day}
  \]

- **Muscle Gain (Slight Surplus):** Aim for 5–10% above TDEE.
  \[
  \text{Calories for Muscle Gain} = 2344 \times 1.05 \, \text{to} \, 1.1 \approx 2460 \, \text{to} \, 2580 \, \text{calories/day}
  \]

- **Recomposition (Maintenance with High-Protein Diet):** Maintain TDEE or slightly adjust based on how your body responds.
  \[
  \text{Calories for Maintenance} \approx 2300 \, \text{to} \, 2400 \, \text{calories/day}
  \]

### **Step 4: Macronutrient Distribution**
- **Protein:** 1.6–2.2 g/kg of body weight to support muscle growth and recovery.
  \[
  \text{Protein Target} = 70 \, \text{kg} \times (1.6 \, \text{to} \, 2.2) \approx 112 \, \text{to} \, 154 \, \text{g/day}
  \]
- **Fats:** 20–30% of total calories for hormonal health.
  \[
  \text{Fat Target} = 2344 \times 0.25 \approx 586 \, \text{calories/day (65 g/day)}
  \]
- **Carbohydrates:** Fill the remaining calories with carbs, which fuel workouts and daily activity.

---

### **Recommended Plan for You**
1. **Calories:** 2300–2400 calories/day for maintenance and body recomposition.
2. **Macronutrients:**
   - Protein: **130–150 g/day**
   - Fat: **60–70 g/day**
   - Carbohydrates: **230–280 g/day**

---

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Track Progress:** Use tools like a food diary or apps (e.g., MyFitnessPal) to track calories and macros.
2. **Prioritize Strength Training:** Focus on resistance exercises to build and preserve muscle.
3. **Adjust as Needed:** If you're losing too quickly (>0.5 kg/week) or gaining fat, adjust your intake by 100–200 calories.
4. **Protein Timing:** Spread protein intake evenly throughout the day for optimal muscle synthesis.
