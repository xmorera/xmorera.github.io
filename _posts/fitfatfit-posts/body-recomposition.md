Your calorie intake during a body recomposition phase will depend on whether your goal is to prioritize fat loss, muscle gain, or maintain your weight while improving body composition. Here’s how you can estimate your recommended calorie intake based on your profile and activity level:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**
Your **BMR** is the number of calories your body needs to perform basic functions at rest. Using the **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation**:
\[
\text{BMR} = 10 \times \text{weight (kg)} + 6.25 \times \text{height (cm)} - 5 \times \text{age (years)} + 5
\]

\[
\text{BMR} = 10 \times 70 + 6.25 \times 166 - 5 \times 46 + 5
\]
\[
\text{BMR} = 700 + 1037.5 - 230 + 5 = 1512.5 \, \text{calories/day}
\]

---

### **Step 2: Adjust for Activity Level**
To account for your daily activity, multiply your BMR by an activity factor:
- **Sedentary:** \( \text{BMR} \times 1.2 \)
- **Lightly Active (e.g., 1-3 days of exercise/week):** \( \text{BMR} \times 1.375 \)
- **Moderately Active (e.g., 3-5 days of exercise/week):** \( \text{BMR} \times 1.55 \)
- **Very Active (e.g., 6-7 days of exercise/week):** \( \text{BMR} \times 1.725 \)

Assuming you are **moderately active** with 300–600 calories burned daily:
\[
\text{TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)} = 1512.5 \times 1.55 = 2344 \, \text{calories/day}
\]

---

### **Step 3: Adjust for Recomposition Goals**
- **Fat Loss (Moderate Deficit):** Aim for 10–20% below TDEE.
  \[
  \text{Calories for Fat Loss} = 2344 \times 0.8 \, \text{to} \, 0.9 \approx 1875 \, \text{to} \, 2110 \, \text{calories/day}
  \]

- **Muscle Gain (Slight Surplus):** Aim for 5–10% above TDEE.
  \[
  \text{Calories for Muscle Gain} = 2344 \times 1.05 \, \text{to} \, 1.1 \approx 2460 \, \text{to} \, 2580 \, \text{calories/day}
  \]

- **Recomposition (Maintenance with High-Protein Diet):** Maintain TDEE or slightly adjust based on how your body responds.
  \[
  \text{Calories for Maintenance} \approx 2300 \, \text{to} \, 2400 \, \text{calories/day}
  \]

---

### **Step 4: Macronutrient Distribution**
- **Protein:** 1.6–2.2 g/kg of body weight to support muscle growth and recovery.
  \[
  \text{Protein Target} = 70 \, \text{kg} \times (1.6 \, \text{to} \, 2.2) \approx 112 \, \text{to} \, 154 \, \text{g/day}
  \]
- **Fats:** 20–30% of total calories for hormonal health.
  \[
  \text{Fat Target} = 2344 \times 0.25 \approx 586 \, \text{calories/day (65 g/day)}
  \]
- **Carbohydrates:** Fill the remaining calories with carbs, which fuel workouts and daily activity.

---

### **Recommended Plan for You**
1. **Calories:** 2300–2400 calories/day for maintenance and body recomposition.
2. **Macronutrients:**
   - Protein: **130–150 g/day**
   - Fat: **60–70 g/day**
   - Carbohydrates: **230–280 g/day**

---

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Track Progress:** Use tools like a food diary or apps (e.g., MyFitnessPal) to track calories and macros.
2. **Prioritize Strength Training:** Focus on resistance exercises to build and preserve muscle.
3. **Adjust as Needed:** If you're losing too quickly (>0.5 kg/week) or gaining fat, adjust your intake by 100–200 calories.
4. **Protein Timing:** Spread protein intake evenly throughout the day for optimal muscle synthesis.

Body recomposition involves simultaneously losing fat and gaining or preserving muscle. It's a challenging but achievable goal, especially for individuals like you with prior weight loss success and a strong commitment to fitness. Here are **key tips** to optimize your recomposition journey:

---

### **1. Prioritize Strength Training**
- **Focus on Resistance Exercises:**
  - Compound movements (e.g., squats, deadlifts, bench presses, pull-ups) engage multiple muscle groups and maximize efficiency.
  - Incorporate isolation exercises to target specific muscles if needed.
- **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weights, reps, or sets to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth.
- **Consistency is Key:** Aim for at least 3–4 resistance training sessions per week.

---

### **2. Maintain a High-Protein Diet**
- **Protein Intake:** Consume 1.6–2.2 g of protein per kg of body weight daily (112–154 g for you).
- **Spread Protein Throughout the Day:**
  - Include 20–40 g of protein per meal to support muscle protein synthesis.
  - Examples: eggs, chicken breast, fish, lean beef, tofu, legumes, protein shakes.
- **Post-Workout Nutrition:** Prioritize protein and carbs after workouts to aid muscle recovery.

---

### **3. Optimize Caloric Intake**
- **Eat at Maintenance or a Slight Deficit:**
  - Maintenance: Helps preserve muscle while losing fat.
  - Slight Deficit: (~250–500 calories below your Total Daily Energy Expenditure) if fat loss is your priority.
- **Adjust Calories as Needed:**
  - If you're losing too quickly or gaining fat, adjust intake by 100–200 calories.

---

### **4. Manage Macronutrients**
- **Protein:** Critical for muscle repair and growth.
- **Carbohydrates:** Provide energy for workouts and recovery. Aim for slow-digesting carbs like oats, quinoa, sweet potatoes, and fruits.
- **Fats:** Support hormonal health; include healthy sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.

---

### **5. Focus on Quality Nutrition**
- **Whole Foods First:** Prioritize minimally processed, nutrient-dense foods to meet your calorie and macro goals.
- **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day (aim for at least 2–3 liters).
- **Micronutrient Support:**
  - Include vegetables, fruits, and whole grains for vitamins and minerals.
  - Consider supplements like vitamin D, omega-3s, or magnesium if dietary intake is insufficient.

---

### **6. Monitor Recovery**
- **Sleep:** Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night to support muscle repair, fat loss, and overall health.
- **Rest Days:** Include rest or active recovery days to avoid overtraining.
- **Stress Management:** Practice relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga to minimize cortisol levels, which can hinder fat loss.

---

### **7. Include Cardio Strategically**
- **Moderation is Key:**
  - Use cardio to complement strength training, not replace it.
  - 2–3 sessions of moderate-intensity cardio (e.g., cycling, swimming) or 1–2 sessions of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) per week.
- **Energy Balance:** Account for cardio calories burned when planning your diet.

---

### **8. Track Progress**
- **Measurements Beyond Weight:**
  - Use body composition metrics (e.g., DEXA scans or body fat calipers).
  - Take regular progress photos and body measurements (waist, chest, thighs).
- **Monitor Strength Gains:** Track improvements in lifts and endurance.
- **Adjust Based on Feedback:** Modify workouts, calories, or macros as needed.

---

### **9. Stay Patient and Consistent**
- Body recomposition is a slow process. Focus on sustainable habits rather than quick fixes.
- Celebrate small wins, such as improved strength, better sleep, or visible changes in body composition.

---

### **10. Avoid Common Pitfalls**
- **Not Eating Enough Protein:** This can hinder muscle retention and growth.
- **Overdoing Cardio:** Too much cardio can reduce recovery and interfere with strength training.
- **Impatience:** Expect gradual changes; fat loss and muscle gain happen at different rates.
- **Neglecting Recovery:** Overtraining can lead to burnout or injury.

---

### **Example Daily Routine**
1. **Morning:** Protein-rich breakfast (e.g., eggs, whole-grain toast, avocado) and light mobility exercises.
2. **Workout:** Strength training session (e.g., 60 minutes) followed by a protein and carb meal.
3. **Lunch/Dinner:** Balanced meals with lean protein, vegetables, and complex carbs.
4. **Snacks:** High-protein snacks (e.g., Greek yogurt, protein bar, nuts).
5. **Evening:** Relaxation, stretching, and adequate sleep.
