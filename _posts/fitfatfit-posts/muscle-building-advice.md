# Muscle Building Advice from Someone That Knows: Jeremy Ethier
I have been losing muscle for the past couple of months, which is totally expected as I just had surgery so I can't go to the f#$@ing gym (nod to Papa Swolio).

I am a couple of weeks away from being able to come back, so I am looking at strategies on how to start building lean mass again, so I came across this video from Jeremy Ethier, a kinesiologist and fitness expert, who has been sharing science-backed muscle-building advice for over a decade:

In a nutshell, building muscle efficiently requires a balanced approach, combining the right exercises, training volume, and nutrition. This article breaks down the science-backed strategies from renowned experts, providing a step-by-step guide to achieving lean mass gains.

Let's see how it goes for me. Right now, circa Oct 21 2024, I hae 31.9 kgs of lean mass. I will update this post with my progress.

## Step 1: Choosing the Right Exercises
Dr. Mike Israetel, a sports physiology expert, emphasizes that quality over quantity is essential when selecting exercises. Here are his top recommendations for major muscle groups:

Chest:
Flat barbell or dumbbell presses
Incline presses
Fly movements
Back:
Pull-ups
Rows
Deadlifts (with strict form)
Flexion rows
Biceps:
Curls from a stretched position (cable, behind the back, incline dumbbell curls)
Triceps:
Overhead movements (stretches the long head)
Cable push-downs
Compound pressing
Shoulders:
Side delt work (dumbbell lateral raises, upright rows, cable laterals)
Legs:
Quads: Barbell squats, leg presses, leg extensions
Hamstrings: Stiff-leg deadlifts, lying or seated leg curls
Calves: Straight-leg calf raises, with a big stretch
Glutes: Lunges, hip thrusts, deep sumo squats
Israetel suggests doing 2 to 4 exercises per muscle per week and changing exercises only when you feel stagnation.

## Step 2: Structuring Your Volume and Frequency
According to Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, 10 to 20 sets per muscle group per week is ideal, but volume should vary based on individual needs. Beginners, for instance, should focus on learning proper movement patterns rather than jumping into high-volume training.

He also advises targeting muscle groups 2-3 times a week to maximize growth, and spreading sets over multiple days can yield better results than doing all sets in one session.

Workout Split Recommendation:

Upper-Lower Split: Divide workouts into upper and lower body sessions, and consider adding a total-body workout day for extra volume.
Step 3: Optimal Rep Range and Progressive Overload
Daniel Plin’s research suggests that the best rep range for hypertrophy is between 5 and 15 reps. He also recommends focusing on double progression, where you increase reps before adding weight.

For example:

Start with 8 reps at a given weight.
Once you can do 12 reps, increase the weight and repeat.

## Step 4: Training Intensity and Failure
Josh from Data Driven Strength highlights that training close to failure can maximize growth, but it also increases fatigue. He suggests aiming for 2-3 reps short of failure on most sets and taking the last set of an exercise to complete failure for maximum gains.

## Step 5: Advanced Techniques – Lengthened Partial Reps
Dr. Milo Wolf explains that partial range of motion exercises at the lengthened part of the movement can accelerate muscle growth by 5-15%. Exercises like lateral raises, curls, and tricep push-downs work well with this technique.

## Step 6: Nutrition – Caloric Surplus and Protein Intake
Nutrition expert Dr. Eric Helms recommends scaling your calorie surplus based on experience level:

Beginners: Aim for 2% of body weight gain per month with a 300-500 calorie surplus.
Intermediates: 1% body weight gain per month with a 200-300 calorie surplus.
Advanced: 0.5-1% body weight gain per month with a 100-200 calorie surplus.
Protein intake should be 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, ideally spread evenly over three meals.

## Step 7: Maximizing Testosterone with Whole Foods
Dr. Allan Aragon emphasizes the importance of whole foods, like eggs, for boosting testosterone levels. Consuming three whole eggs post-exercise, compared to egg whites, significantly enhances muscle gains and increases testosterone levels.

## Conclusion
By following this blueprint, combining optimal exercises, volume, frequency, and progressive overload with solid nutrition, you will be on your way to achieving impressive muscle growth. Keep fine-tuning your plan as you progress, and remember, consistency is key!
