In my posts I talk about AI, ML, Big Data, programming, and most recently I started a health transformation where I lost 1/3 of my body weight and went from obese to fit.

I am writing a book telling you how I did it, because it all comes down to one thing, _the application of knowledge to make decisions, solve problems, and achieve goals_. 

The book is called **Unfatting Myself: Getting Fit in Your Middle Age â€“ A Story of How to Get to Health, Fitness, and Nutrition**
