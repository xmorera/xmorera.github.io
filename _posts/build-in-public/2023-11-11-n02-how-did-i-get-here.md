# How Did I Get Here?
There are many reasons why someone starts a company. In some cases it is plain and simple. They want to be rich. 

In other cases, they identify a problem and believe they have a solution, which is a great way to start a company. 

Or perhaps, and IMHO this is the worst case scenario... they have a solution and try to find a problem. This one does not work very well.

It may also be a combination of a few of the above.

But from time to time, a company was born sort of by accident. And this is kind of what happened to me with [Lupo.ai](https://lupo.ai).

Let me tell you how this happened, by going back 20 years.
